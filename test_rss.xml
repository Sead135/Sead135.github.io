      <p><span class="drop">I</span>f you missed our two-episode miniseries on cryptocurrency
        earlier this month, or you simply want to relive the thrill of learning about blockchain
        technology and its impact on finance, the environment, and politics, you can now watch the
        episodes on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCutLfFIgGyTA4RkAEwDVKTQ">our YouTube
        channel</a>.</p> <!--more-->
      <p>The title of the miniseries, <em>Tales from the Crypto</em>, is of course an allusion to
        the classic 1950’s horror comic <em>Tales from the Crypt</em>. We chose it not only because
        of the obvious word play but also because both advocates and skeptics of cryptocurrency talk
        about it in a way that suggests <em>danger</em>: advocates see it as a threat to traditional
        power centers such as banks and governments, while skeptics see it as a threat to the
        stability of markets, to regulatory regimes designed to protect ordinary citizens from
        financial scams and bubbles, and to the environment.</p>
      <h2 id="episode-1-the-thing-from-the-blockchain">Episode 1: “The Thing from the Blockchain!”</h2>
      <p>In the first episode of <em>Tales from the Crypto</em>, SUNY Geneseo computer scientist and
        professor of mathematics Dr. Doug Baldwin offers a spinetingling introduction to blockchain,
        cryptographic authentication, and other technologies that have brought cryptocurrency to
        life.</p>

      <h2 id="what-is-ada-lovelace-day">What is Ada Lovelace Day?</h2>
      <p>Ada Lovelace Day is a day for celebrating women’s achievements in STEM fields: science,
        technology, engineering, and mathematics. Founded in England in 2009 by <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suw_Charman-Anderson">Suw Charman-Anderson</a>, it’s
        become an international event, held every year on the second Tuesday of October. This year,
        ALD takes place on October 12.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://findingada.com">Finding ADA</a> website coordinates ALD events
        worldwide, including webinars that you can stream for free. <a
          href="https://findingada.com/events/ada-lovelace-day-live/">This year’s</a> are on <strong>“Engineering
        — Solving Problems for Real People,” “Fusing Tech &amp; Art in Games,”</strong> and <strong>“The
        Science of Hypersleep.”</strong> The site also serves as an aggregator for <a
          href="https://findingada.com/worldwide-events/">independently organized ALD events</a>.</p>
      <h2 id="who-was-ada-lovelace">Who was Ada Lovelace?</h2>
      <p>Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (1815-1852) was a mathematical prodigy considered by
        some to be the first “computer programmer” in an age when neither computing nor programming
        existed as we know them today. The daughter of English Romantic poet Lord Byron (a fact she
        didn’t learn until his death, when she was eight), she also, in the words of James Gleick,
        “saw mathematics as merely a part of a greater imaginative world.” In his book <a
          href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-information-a-history-a-theory-a-flood/9781400096237">
          <em>The Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood</em>
        </a>, Gleick describes
        Lovelace’s intellectual relationship with her contemporary Charles Babbage, who had a vision
        of two machines, a “difference engine” and an “analytical engine” — the first to calculate
        numbers mechanically, the second to perform more general operations — neither of which was
        ever built. It was Lovelace, Gleick writes, who had the insight that the analytical engine,
        rather than being a mere calculator, could in theory “process any meaningful relationship.
        It might manipulate language. It might create music. … It had been an engine of numbers; now
        it became an engine of information.” The same insight is fundamental to the workings of
        modern-day computers, capable of “computing” — i.e., processing — words, sounds, and images
        as information to bring texts, speech, music, photos, and video to our many electronic
        devices.</p>
      <p>In her selection of Lovelace’s letters, <a
          href="https://people.well.com/user/adatoole/PoeticalScience.htm">
          <em>Ada, The Enchantress of Numbers: Poetical Science</em>
        </a>, Betty Alexandra
        Toole gives us this excerpt from a letter of Ada to the mathematician Augustus De Morgan
        (who helped her advance her mathematical skills via correspondence, in a kind of
        nineteenth-century version of distance learning):</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Imagination is the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Discovering</span> Faculty,
          pre-eminently. It is that which penetrates into the unseen worlds around us, the worlds of
          Science. … Mathematical Science shows what <span style="text-decoration:underline;">is</span>.
          It is the language of unseen relations between things. But to use &amp; apply that
          language we must be able fully to appreciate, to feel, to seize, the unseen, the
          unconscious. Imagination too shows what <span style="text-decoration:underline;">is</span>,
          the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">is</span> beyond the senses. Hence she is or
          should be especially cultivated by the truly Scientific, — those who wish to enter into
          the worlds around us!</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In the spirit of Ada Lovelace’s interdisciplinary perspective, the CDL’s celebration of Ada
        Lovelace Day will highlight not only the achievements of women in STEM but also the ways in
        which the methods and insights of STEM fields and those of the arts and humanities inform
        each other — or, at least, ought to.</p>

        organizational structure and collaborative partnerships with other highly regarded and
        effective departments on campus such as CIT, TLC, CDL, Milne Library, and DAPA. We also
        aimed to establish an online presence through <a href="https://www.geneseo.edu/cdl">our
        website</a> and other forms of communication, develop a strategic plan for the future of
        digital learning at Geneseo, and launch workshops to help faculty, staff, and students
        increase their knowledge of and facility with digital tools for teaching, scholarship,
        creative practice, and productivity.</p> <!--more-->
      <p>We have lots of plans for the year ahead. Overall, we’re looking foward to moving past the
        “pandemic mode” that we operated in for much of our first year. We learned a lot from this
        work, and we’re eager both to continue supporting the structures that we helped put in place
        during this time and to build on these services in an increasingly in-person capacity. But
        the pandemic also forced us to put a few exciting ideas on the shelf for a bit, and we’re
        more than ready to get back to work on them. Stick with us this semester to see the cool
        things we have in store! :sunglasses:</p>
      <p>And have a treat to celebrate our birthday … maybe you can stop by in person for next
        year’s celebration! :birthday:</p>

      </p>
      <p><span class="drop">A</span>s digital classrooms became the “new normal” in lieu of physical
        classrooms during the pandemic, many social aspects of learning took a hit. Without
        in-person meetings, many students came to feel isolated from their peers and instructors.
        Feeling disconnected from a shared learning environment lowers our motivation to participate
        and keeping up with coursework quickly becomes a struggle. There are many factors in this
        widespread sense of burn-out — a decline in mental health, political stressors, and family
        crises are just a few that come to mind — but one factor with a feasible solution is the
        lack of genuine human connection in digital learning environments. We don’t want students to
        feel alone if they’re struggling, but the unfortunate reality is that they often do. One
        solution to this problem is fostering a stronger human connection between instructors and
        students, in the hope of creating a more supportive digital learning community.</p> <!--more-->
      <h2 id="what-instructors-can-do">What instructors can do</h2>
      <p>Because we are all aware of the myriad stressors students are facing right now, as an
        instructor, establishing a sense of shared humanity in student-instructor interactions is
        critical. Students need to feel welcome in order to communicate honestly and openly with
        their instructors about what is going on in their lives should a crisis occur, but this is
        difficult to do if students have no sense of personal connection to their instructor, or
        even to the other students in their class.</p>
      <p>Synchronous courses offer a digital venue for creating these connections via Zoom; however,
        many courses are asynchronous. Unfortunately, the ability of discussion boards to institute
        a sense of human connection pales in comparison to class discussions in real time. So what
        can instructors do to ensure that, even in asynchronous courses, students feel comfortable
        reaching out?</p>
      <p>Instructors might endeavor to “humanize” their course content and communications with
        students. Including an “About Me” page on Canvas helps students gain a sense of their
        instructor as a person, not just an authority figure who creates and grades assignments.
        Adding a brief personal component to class-wide announcements — like sharing something
        interesting that happened over the weekend, some feelings about current events, or simply
        wishing students well — also helps students connect with their instructors on a human level.
        When students see their instructors as people rather than academic overseers, they are more
        likely to seek support from them should support be needed.</p>
      <p>With a more open, personable online presence, instructors create a transparent learning
        environment where students are welcome to be just as open and honest with their instructors.
        In addition to this communication between students and professors being personable, it is
        crucial that it be clear and prompt as well. Instructors taking action and not only
        identifying, but supporting, struggling individuals is also a means of creating a stronger
        bond between themselves and their students. Making the first move to check in with those who
        may be having difficulty with a course, or a particular assignment, can be all that it takes
        for a student to feel seen and heard — especially those who may be reluctant to ask for help
        when they truly need it. If possible, having some sort of weekly check-in (perhaps in the
        form of a discussion board or email) could be the push some students need to stay engaged,
        motivated, and in touch.</p>
      <h2 id="what-students-can-do">What students can do</h2>
      <p>In order to reinvigorate human connection in a digital learning setting, students and
        instructors need to work together. Instructors are facing a similar increase in workload and
        stress as students: we are all members of the same world, after all. Because faculty are in
        a position of authority, students may forget that they are people facing the same hard times
        as everyone else. There are a few things students can keep in mind in order to treat and
        respect their instructors as fellow human beings.</p>
      <p>In digital communications through Canvas or email, students should try to be mindful of
        their words and tone. Addressing faculty by their proper title and name when composing an
        email is more respectful than an empty greeting — such as “Hi” or “Hello” (with no name) —
        that fails to address that instructor’s humanity. Including a brief statement at the
        beginning of the message, like “I hope you’re doing well,” shows that the student cares
        about their professor as a person, not just as an instructor. These are both simple elements
        students can add to their communications that humanize the student-instructor relationship.
        The <a href="https://cdl-geneseo.github.io/news/2021/05/05/dear-professor/">CDL
        micro-workshop</a> on crafting the perfect extension request email to a professor reiterates
        these elements and is a good resource for students to refer to.</p>
      <p>In a synchronous course setting, where a class meets on Zoom, students might also try (as
        much as they are comfortable doing) to turn their cameras on. As an instructor, lecturing
        into “the void” of blank screens probably feels, well, devoid of genuine human connection
        and interaction. The opportunity for visual connection with a class is valuable because it
        makes the learning experience seem more “real,” or more like an in-person class, for
        everyone — though it should be noted that this may not be a viable option for all students,
        whether that be due to their environment during class or not having access to the most
        capable technology. Not to mention, turning on a camera can be downright uncomfortable for
        some, especially if no one else has theirs on. It can certainly be intimidating to make the
        first move, but if your contribution gives another student the confidence to speak up, the
        momentary stress is worth it.</p>
      <p>Even when turning your camera on is not possible, there are other opportunities for
        meaningful interaction. Adding a profile photo to your Zoom account is only one example; if
        you do not feel comfortable having your camera on for the duration of class, your professor
        and classmates can at least have something else to look at instead of the aforementioned
        “void.” The picture does not necessarily have to be of yourself, either! Provided that it is
        school-appropriate and not too distracting for others, you could use a picture of your pet,
        the logo of your favorite sports team, or perhaps of a character from a movie you enjoy. <a
          href="https://en.gravatar.com/">Gravatar</a> is another great resource when it comes to
        choosing a profile photo, as it allows you to use the same image across multiple accounts on
        the web. In addition, sending short messages in chat can go a long way in terms of creating
        a sense of community and familiarity within a synchronous course — not only between students
        and the professor, but between students themselves.</p>
      <h2 id="what-everyone-can-do">What everyone can do</h2>
      <p>Be honest, and be understanding. Express your emotions, struggles, and triumphs to the
        people in your learning community. Even if we are not physically nearby, technology doesn’t
        take away our ability for human connection. It may even offer some surprising new
        opportunities.</p>
      <p>Expressing your humanity — in respectful, thoughtful ways — reminds us all that we are
        experiencing this together. Most important, we will all get through this together! At the
        same time, keep in mind that what may be easy for you will not necessarily be easy for
        everyone. Despite our similarities, we all lead lives with unique abilities, settings, and
        challenges. We should honor our differences when it comes to online learning by coming to
        class with open, understanding minds.</p>
      <p>Reinstating the sense of human connection between instructors and students will help
        alleviate the isolation many students and faculty in higher education are feeling right now.
        Forming genuine connections helps motivate students to stay engaged with their learning
        community, and creates a more compassionate learning environment for everyone.</p>

        <em>Editor’s note: This post is one in a series by Geneseo faculty who in Intersession 2021
          taught courses that either focused centrally on issues of racial justice or incorporated
          those issues via dedicated modules and interwoven content. To find all posts in this
          series, part of Geneseo’s project of <a

          antiracist college</a>, look for the <a href="/labels#tags">tag “intersession 2021”</a>.</em>
      </p>
      <p><span class="drop">I</span>n July 2018, I received a grant from Geneseo’s Teaching and
        Learning Center to create a series of modules for the course Visual Culture Today. My
        student assistant, Thomas Mossey (a sophomore at the time), joined me in front of a computer
        screen as we tried to figure out how to create a module on representations of African
        Americans in mainstream media. Tommy prepared several examples for me to look at, but all of
        them were difficult to use as a tool of empowerment. We found stereotypical representations
        easily: Aunt Jemima, Mammy, and countless other caring Black women of indeterminate age.
        That summer, we centered the module on such stereotypical representations and asked students
        to watch racist cartoons showing white people in “black face.” We asked students to reflect
        on whether and by whom (if anyone) these cartoons should still be seen.</p>
      <p>In fall 2018, I taught this module in a face-to-face classroom. We talked about the idea of
        “re-presentation” and that often media distorts rather than reflects reality. As part of the
        learning materials, students were directed to a video, <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqlD-eZm1ck">Blackface: A cultural history of a
        racist art form</a>, that discussed this racist practice.</p> <!--more-->
      <p>The students were warned in advance that the material might be offensive or disturbing.
        After watching the video, the students were also offered the option to pursue a library of
        racist cartoons and minstrel shows and reflect on what should be done about cultural
        heritage of this sort. The material and resulting discussions were occasionally very
        difficult, both for the students and for me as their instructor. Many times, we had to stop
        and assess whether, as a class, we were willing and able to continue. Often, the students’
        responses to the module surprised me. Most thought that the stereotypical representations,
        and especially “black face,” should just be excluded from our culture. Some went as far as
        to argue that they should not even be accessible to scholars for research. Others thought
        that the documentation should remain but should be accessed only for research or for
        understanding of the past in order not to create similar mistakes in the future. These
        conversations were some of the best that we had in the class. The material ignited students’
        passion and inspired them to express their opinions in a way that most of the textbooks do
        not. In the responses, I read words such as “awful,” “disgusting,” “hurtful,” and
        “traumatic.” But I also knew from further discussion that the students felt safe to express
        their opinions. They expressed a desire to work more on topics of race and visual culture. I
        knew that I had hit an important point.</p>
      <h2 id="covid-intersession-continuity-and-rupture">Covid intersession: continuity and rupture</h2>
      <p>When I was preparing for the Covid intersession edition of Visual Culture Today, I wanted
        to return and redo the module on the representation of people of color, but I knew that I
        wanted to make it more relevant to the current understanding of antiracism. Mainly, it was
        important to give some examples of positive representation and address more recent issues of
        representation. Tommy was doing an independent study class with me in fall 2020, and he was
        as excited as I was to rethink our approach. Our methodology this time was to show the
        continuity and rupture between the representation of the past and present when it comes to
        blackness. So in addition to the discussion of stereotypical historical representations, we
        concentrated on more contemporary artists, such as Amy Sherald, who focuses on art
        historical realism and Black subjects.</p>
      <p>Sherald is best known now for two commissioned paintings, one of Michelle Obama and the
        other of Breonna Talyor. There is a quiet, dignified, and embodied presence conveyed in
        Sherald’s portraits. It takes a bit of time for the viewer to realize what keeps them
        looking at the person depicted. The artist portrays brown and black skin using gray tones,
        so while the overall impression of the skin is dark, the color does not mimic reality.
        According to Sherald, she wanted to represent people of color but avoid being slotted into
        the identity politics part of art. She was interested in changing our perception of darker
        skin to make it more universal and innovative, or <a
          href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/podcasts/still-processing-we-paint-the-town-obama.html">as
        New York <em>Times</em> culture critics Wesley Morris and Jenna Wortham recently noted</a>,
        convey “blackness without the gaze of whiteness.”</p>
      <p>The students were really impressed by Sherald’s work. In the discussion posts, they told me
        again and again about their interest in portraits. Many decided to find out more about the
        portraits and the artists and noted the importance of relatability and positive role models
        for up-and-coming artists and art historians.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Another part of the new version of the module was use of art during the recent Black Lives
        Matter protests. We provided an <a
          href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/5/21304985/black-lives-matter-murals-round-up-artists">article
        from <em>The Verge</em></a> that reports on numerous murals and on public artwork that
        commemorates BLM and its participants. We asked students to choose one that they found most
        interesting and explain why. That way they had to combine their knowledge and passion about
        the subject with what art historians call “formal analysis”—consideration of elements in an
        artwork such as color, composition, form, and rhythm.</p>
      <p>In developing the module, one of my learning objectives was to inspire students to think
        about the role of art in everyday life. Looking at the discussions and reflections, I think
        I succeeded. The students told me that now, when they look at social media, they notice how
        people of color are represented. They note that they often pay more attention to the
        graffiti and art in public areas and have more curiosity about these images. I realize that
        what I have done in this module is just a drop in the proverbial bucket, and that it is
        hardly enough even to start an in-depth conversation. However, together with the other
        issues that we cover in the class, such as female empowerment, science as spectacle, and
        gender in advertising, I think I can introduce students to the multifaceted and often
        exclusionary world of visual culture. As consumers and producers of visuality, my students
        can help shape the field—even if they do so one drop or image at a time.</p>

        are excited to invite faculty and staff to a conversation reflecting on the past year of
        pandemic online teaching: how it’s felt, what it’s taught us about ourselves and our

        </a> to join the conversation.</p> <!--more-->
      <p>Our goals for this session are to reconnect with you, review where we’ve all been since
        this time last year, and think about how we can best resume our collective work as educators
        in the post-pandemic future.</p>
      <p>While preparing for this conversation, the TLC and CDL spent a lot of time thinking and
        talking through the many facets of pandemic teaching and learning, and how we anticipate
        moving forward informed by that experience. We all agreed: there is no going back to the
        “normal” operations of pre-pandemic times. Dave pointed out that our conclusion paralleled
        the message of Joshua Eyler’s May 2021 presentation for the <a
          href="https://colab.plymouthcreate.net/">Plymouth State University OPENCoLab</a> titled <a
          href="https://colab.plymouthcreate.net/resource/joshua-eyler-keynote-on-grief-loss-building-a-post-pandemic-future-for-higher-ed-without-losing-sight-of-our-students-and-ourselves/">“On
        Grief &amp; Loss: Building a Post-Pandemic Future for Higher Ed without Losing Sight of Our
        Students and Ourselves”</a>, in which Eyler invoked the movie <em>Back to the Future</em> to
        imagine how returning to “normal” would feel.</p>
      <p>
        <img src="/images/marty.png" alt="Marty McFly from Back to the Future looking perplexed" />
      </p>
      <p>Eyler takes an apt look at how the pandemic has affected higher education — physically,
        mentally, emotionally, institutionally — and how, despite efforts to the contrary at some
        institutions, the equity that we’ve discovered and worked to achieve bit by bit during this
        time cannot be set aside in a frantic move to go back to the way things were.</p>
      <p>Below are some moments from Eyler’s recorded talk we’ve found to be particularly relevant
        to our planned conversation on the 11th. Click on any of the YouTube embeds below to start
        at the snippet in question, which is also transcribed beneath.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>So you combine the grief and the loss of this momentous crisis, and you add the traumatic
          element to this, and what you have . . . is a major crisis, . . . not just of education,
          but of all the spheres that encase education: faculty, students, staff — the ways that we
          live our lives that intersect with work, but that go well beyond work. So it is a true
          crisis. So given that, the message you might expect to hear from universities would be,
          “We understand. It’s been a really hard time. We’ll be taking that into account as we move
          forward.” But the message that I actually see many universities sending is this one: that
          we’re going back to normal. We’re going back to pre-pandemic operations. . . . Look at
          Marty McFly’s face here. Marty McFly is all of us, hearing the message that we’re going
          back to normal, pre-pandemic operations. Because the truth is, there <em>is</em> no going
          back. You cannot undo what has happened. You cannot go back to February or March of 2020,
          because the end of grief, the end of loss, the end of change is never a return. There’s
          never a going-back. There’s only a different destination.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>So one of the silver linings, or one of the bright spots, in this dark time over the last
          15 months has been that for the first time, certainly in my career, the spotlight was put
          on issues of student agency, empathy, flexibility. . . . So universities at the drop of a
          hat changed their grading policies to pass-fail. . . . I cannot imagine anything else that
          could have happened to force the conversation about grading and actually make a change
          like that happen.</p>
        <p>Same is true of the discussion about flexible attendance, about flexible deadlines, about
          student workload, about the kinds of assessments and assignments that we’re giving: the
          spotlight was cast, at least on the student side, of how do we recognize the humanity of
          students, and how do we use that in our pedagogy. We need to continue that. I think we’re
          in an important moment, where the spotlight is fading on that a little bit. We need to
          continue that work.</p>
        <p>The same is true of faculty and staff. We got new policies in our universities that were
          recognizing, well, okay, remote work and flexible work, in many cases, and other ways of
          being flexible — you know, at some universities the tenure clock was extended, at some
          universities student evaluations were suspended for a year or more. So this nod toward, or
          this extension toward, humanity and empathy was kind of widespread across the board. . . .</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Students will remember the changes that we made for them. . . . And they will wonder, why
          are we going back? Faculty and staff will not forget the changes that were made to make
          their work conditions be more flexible, and to center them in the process. They won’t
          forget. And so, we ignore that, and we create a system that [is] less equitable than it
          was before. Because now people know that it’s possible to change.</p>

        responses and connections to your own experiences from this past year, as well as your own

      <p>Invite your colleagues, too. Together, we can continue, in Eyler’s words, to “hold the

      <p><span class="drop">F</span>or our final micro-workshop of this semester, the CDL hosted
        “Dear Professor: crafting the perfect email to your professor” presented by Paul Schacht.
        Finals are almost upon us, and students may find themselves even more overwhelmed than they
        have been all semester during the pandemic. Dr. Schacht shares encouraging and helpful tips,
        from a professor’s perspective, for how students can respectfully and effectively reach out
        to their professors for extensions on assignments or to request to take an exam on a later
        date. And, while the professor’s perspective is a great thing to have when considering how
        to email them, the CDL was thrilled to include the perspective of one of our Student
        Affiliates, <a href="https://cdl-geneseo.github.io/authors/raupp/">Emma Raupp</a>, on this
        topic as well. Emma shares her own experience with reaching out to professors and reassures
        students facing common worries.</p>
      <p>From crafting the perfect subject line that will catch your professor’s attention to
        appreciating the humanity that exists between the two of you when communicating your needs,
        this session will definitely make you feel more confident about advocating for yourself as a

      <p>The course has no prerequisites.</p> <!--more-->
      <p>Here’s the full course description:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Digital technologies are reshaping scholarship in fields across the humanities from
          literature to music to history. In this course, we will explore the perspectives of
          scholars who have thought about what “digital humanities” means and the technologies and
          tools being used to shape research, scholarship, and publishing, with a particular focus
          on the discipline of History. Topics will include the history of the digital humanities,
          textual studies, computational and new media, and emerging work around text, image, and
          new media curation and visualization. The final two weeks of the course will be dedicated
          to the study of the field of Digital Humanities in a non-Eurocentric setting and with a
          non-Latin script, in this case, Arabic script and the History of the Islamic world. Active
          engagement by all participants is expected. Students will contribute to the field with a
          creative final project that they develop over the course of the semester.</p>

        18 community conversation</a> on student workload in online courses, co-sponsored by the
        Student Association and the Center for Digital Learning, gave all involved a lot to think
        about.</p>
      <p>The event invited students, staff, and faculty to talk candidly with each other about their
        experiences with and perspectives on student workload during “emergency remote” pandemic
        instruction. On social media, students throughout higher education, including those at
        Geneseo, were describing how burdened they feel. On this issue and others impacting
        students’ mental, emotional, academic health, they were also insisting that <em>talking
          isn’t enough</em>. Action was required. Soon.</p> <!--more-->
      <p>At the same time, some faculty were describing their exhausting efforts to meet student
        needs and limitations while handling their own challenges, noting that it might be beyond
        their power to change some of the things frustrating their students.</p>
      <p>With this context in mind, we set out to design a session for students to share their
        feelings and experiences in a welcoming environment. We invited faculty and staff to attend
        as well: to share, but mostly to listen. We wanted students to receive a hearing from open
        hearts and minds. And we wanted to come away with ideas for action.</p>
      <p>As one office in a complex institution, the CDL can’t effect institutional change all by
        itself. But we want to do everything we can to help students where they’re at <em>now</em>,
        hopefully in time to get them through the rest of what we anticipate to be their last
        semester of emergency pandemic learning. Fortunately, there are a few ways our center can
        help, as I’ll explain below.</p>
      <p>Our time together on March 18 was divided into three parts:</p>

      <p>Facilitators provided a blank slide deck in Google slides asking “How are you feeling?”

          href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fo4ANOcbeNZOeYs2a4k6CbplSlvyXpPk7EQLMJMN6zM/edit?usp=sharing">
        slides</a>.</p>
      <p>This session exposed a number of realities for both students and faculty.</p>
      <h3 id="students-missing-friends--and-breaks">Students: Missing friends … and breaks</h3>
      <p>Covid-19 has taken a toll on everyone’s social life, but for college students it’s extra
        impactful. Students shared that the precautions Geneseo and most universities have taken to
        protect everyone during the pandemic have exacerbated feelings of loneliness and isolation.
        Furthermore, students pointed out that repeated Zoom meetings and near-constant screen use
        have made it difficult to leave their rooms during the day and socialize in person even to
        the extent to which they are permitted.</p>
      <p>Additionally, while the college has implemented “rejuvenation days” in lieu of the
        conventional Thanksgiving or Spring break, students don’t feel that they get a real
        opportunity to rejuvenate, as many are saddled with due dates immediately following.
        Students miss having an extended period of time to not think about their work and recharge.
        The same screen-time that keeps students from socializing with those in their bubbles is
        also a constant exposure to their work as they find themselves going from Zoom call to
        discussion board to assignment in one continuous flow.</p>
      <p>Some students single out discussion boards as one task in particular that overloads their
        to-do lists. Many students feel that requiring lengthy discussion board responses overlooks
        the time-consuming reality of that work. As one student put it:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>I have noticed for my hybrid “in person” classes when I share within a conversation I am <strong>
          energized</strong> by the discussion. Virtually discussing (particularly canvas discussion
          boards) where I have to write responses leave me feeling <strong>exhausted</strong>.
          Especially since I am writing 400-500 word responses for multiple discussion boards over 4
          courses multiple times a week. <em>(Slide 21)</em></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>All-in-all, students are feeling run-down and overburdened, and they don’t know how to
        overcome this situation.</p>
      <h3 id="students-feeling-lost-and-lacking-structure">Students: Feeling lost and lacking
        structure</h3>
      <p>According to what students shared in the slides, a good deal of their anxiety is coming
        from feeling “lost” in their courses. Some students describe this as constantly worrying
        whether or not they’re missing a deadline or not being able to locate the relevant materials
        instructors have shared in Canvas. Hand-in-hand with this issue is the fact that some
        students are struggling with either not not finding structure in their course’s Canvas
        presence or not understanding the structure they find there.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, there are students stressed by the pressure of gathering information and
        “teaching” it to themselves rather than having the guidance of either a synchronous lecture
        or carefully crafted modules that purposefully present information. While video lectures can
        help, some students struggle to find time to watch those lectures on top of their other
        assignments.</p>
      <p>There is a common theme in these concerns: <em>organization</em>, both at the student and
        faculty level. Pandemic teaching and learning have asked both groups to change the way they
        structure work and communicate about it. As if this weren’t difficult enough, in remote
        classes neither students and faculty find it challenging to build the empathetic, genuine
        relationships they know how to create in a shared physical space.</p>
      <h3 id="faculty-feeling-constrained-and-in-the-dark">Faculty: Feeling constrained and in the
        dark</h3>
      <p>While we didn’t get a lot of faculty feedback in this session, as it was primarily aimed at
        student experiences, we did get some. There was a general feeling of being constrained and
        blocked, one aspect of the lack of connection discussed earlier.</p>
      <p>Faculty shared that they miss out on tailoring their class time and instruction to their
        students’ unique interests and personalities, as many faculty maintain that each class has a
        different overall “self.” They also shared that they feel constrained in the way they can
        communicate with students, whether using Canvas or email; there was some frustration
        expressed at their inability to do either when a student misses a Covid test and is locked
        out of accounts and classes (Slide 15).</p>
      <p>This faculty perspective is invaluable to our understanding of the overall picture of
        student workload and the current student experience, and we appreciate those who were
        willing to share with us during the session.</p>
      <h2 id="strange-case">Annotating Jody Greene's "The Strange Case of the Exploding Student
        Workload"</h2>
      <h3 id="the-article">The article</h3>
      <p>This portion of our session was dedicated to a live-annotation of <a
          href="https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/just-visiting/guest-post-strange-case-exploding-student-workload">Jody
        Greene’s</a> article featured in <em>Inside Higher Ed</em> last December, “The Strange Case
        of the Exploding Student Workload.”</p>
      <h3 id="the-task">The task</h3>
      <p>We placed Greene’s article in four Google docs shared only with the participants and asked
        them to use the highlight and comments functions to dissect the issues and ideas brought up
        in the article and respond to one another’s observations. The article was copied into four
        identical docs in order to keep one document from getting overwhelmed by comments.</p>
      <h3 id="the-results">The results</h3>
      <p>While the article is relatively brief, it took some time to get through for those who
        hadn’t had the chance to read it ahead of time. But after a bit, slowly but surely, we
        started to see lots of highlighting and comments. Here are some of the most striking points
        our participants drew out of the article:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>F(aculty): I have opted to eliminate many of my typical assignments from all of my
          classes in order to streamline them … and hopefully make them more manageable. »
          S(tudent): I think that this would be more than beneficial to students. Spending time on
          assignments has taken away from my understanding of the class as a whole. I find myself
          focusing more on getting the assignment done than grasping the material.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>F: I was not prepared to have students email me that they had lost a loved one to covid
          and wanting to still push through and get through the course. Math seems irrelevant at
          that point.</p>

        <p>F: One of the struggles that needs to be addressed both from a workload and a mental
          health aspect is the opportunity to fail. Failure is no longer defined as poor
          participation or contributions to class - it is not feeling comfortable approaching online
          professors for help and disappearing. » S: This is true! I feel that the lack of
          face-to-face connection with professors makes it so much harder to feel comfortable

        <p>S: How to grade class participation seems to have definitely been a struggle for a lot of
          my professors. There is a large energy difference between commenting in person in a class
          and writing discussion board posts and replies. These small assignments take a lot of
          energy when multiplied over 3-4 courses. They are typically worth very little in terms of
          grading.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>S: Something that’s helped in a couple of my courses is to make it so that students are
          able to “skip” 2-3 assignments in a particular category (discussion posts, reading
          responses, etc.) so that students can opt out of an assignment if they’re having a tough
          day/week, if needed, but only a few times per semester</p>

      <p>Because the slide activity was about sharing highly personal feelings, it was designed to
        provided anonymity. The annotation exercise was more about responded to and connecting
        around Greene’s ideas, so identification was not only less problematic but also more
        conducive to generating an authentic conversation. We were thrilled to see all parties do
        exactly that, and especially to see students comfortably responding to faculty comments.</p>
      <h2 id="breakout-rooms">Breakout rooms with discussion questions and a collaborative
        note-taking document</h2>
      <p>Our last activity of the session was to send the attendees into breakout rooms to address a
        set of <a
          href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L_P5XukB-Qxe4sHZmx8JHypMXKjREfn3tNechsxlUVE/edit?usp=sharing">discussion
        questions</a>. Each breakout room was intentionally configured to include multiple students
        for each faculty or staff member present. We wanted to amplify student voices by providing
        them greater representation. In addition, we didn’t want any students to feel intimidated by
        being the only student in a room of faculty/staff. Not surprisingly, the announcement of
        breakout rooms caused some students to drop off Zoom (some at the very outset of the
        meeting, even more as the rooms were being created), complicating our efforts and leaving
        the room ratio skewed toward faculty and staff.</p>
      <p>Designated notetakers in each group added to a single collaborative <a
          href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19P71sz-X6Meuod-vPaeRfzqKD_e2e2NRZP16JgLF4Bw/edit?usp=sharing">Google
        doc</a>, enabling all groups to see how each group addressed its assigned question. While
        each group was assigned a single question, we ended up with an “orphaned” question intended
        for a Group 3 that ended up with no members. Responses in the doc to Group 3’s question came
        from other groups, who were invited to address it once they’d finished discussing their
        assigned question.</p>
      <p>Reading through this collaborative document, you’ll find a common theme: students asking
        for <em>clarity</em>. This ask is a clear extension of the desire for organization and
        structure expressed earlier in the previous session activities. Students are concerned about
        not understanding their professors’ expectations from the get-go. While it may seem like the
        answer to this concern would be to reach out to these professors, that may be a substantial
        barrier for students, and might not result in a prompt reply depending on the circumstances,
        thereby leaving students to rely solely on their assumptions.</p>

      <p>It’s no secret that we’re approaching the end of this semester, which will, hopefully, be
        our last semester of pandemic-required online instruction and learning. The time is short to
        help students where they’re at <em>now</em>. We’ve been working on some ideas designed to
        guide students to a successful end-of-semester as well as help them in their future
        learning, whether online or in person.</p>
      <h3 id="micro-workshops-for-student-success">Micro-workshops for student success</h3>
      <p>It never hurts to add some tools to one’s toolbox. We’re working to create some 30-minute
        workshops on resources and practices that, if put to use immediately, could help some
        students better manage learning in a comparatively unstructured environment.</p>
      <p>The message to students here is definitely <em>not</em> “Pull yourselves up by your
        bootstraps.” It’s more like, “When the situtation feels out of control, control anything you
        can.”</p>
      <p>Ideas here include a workshop on leveraging Gmail’s tools for managing email overload and
        another on effectively requesting flexibility on deadlines. We hope to bring these and more
        “micro workshops” to students before the end of the semester.</p>

        beyond the pale, we’ll be aggregating helpful resources on the topics covered in our
        micro-workshops and highlighting the experiences of fellow students, their pandemic learning
        struggles, and how they’re handling them. We’ll share what we collect right here on our <a

      <p>Ultimately, it’s our, and everyone’s, hope that this will be the last pandemic learning
        experience for a long time.</p>
      <p>The said, even when pandemic learning and instruction are over, the effects of this
        experience will be long-lasting in various ways.</p>
      <p>One of the most exciting effects is a new embrace of online learning at Geneseo. There is
        clearly interest from both faculty and students in more, and better, opportunities for
        online instruction, with its potential to alleviate schedule conflicts and create more
        flexible paths to degree completion.</p>
      <p>The CDL is thrilled to support instructors who are interested in continuing to teach online
        in fall 2021 through this summer’s Online Teaching Institute, under development by Geneseo’s
        talented team of <a href="https://www.geneseo.edu/cit/instructional-design">Instructional

      </p>
      <p><span class="drop">M</span>y goal for my Interssession 2021 course, Topics in Literature:
        Race and Representation in Text and Media, was to not ignore the racial tension and
        injustices that are occurring in our country. I wanted students to be given the opportunity
        to explore these topics and issues in a creative, safe format. With this in mind, I chose
        the texts <em>Dear Martin</em> by Nic Stone and <em>The Hate U Give</em> by Angie Thomas. I
        chose these two texts to incorporate into my syllabi as a way of starting the conversation
        on racism and racial injustice. I wanted students to read and expand their understanding of
        racial issues and the treatment that Black Americans face.</p> <!--more-->
      <p>I intentionally broke up the course so that students focused on one novel and module a
        week. Each week, students read a novel, had class discussions, and then responded to what
        they read through completing a weekly reader’s response. It was important that each class
        discussion connect the themes in the text to what is occurring in society today. Students
        discussed topics such as racism, police brutality, media representation, and racial
        injustice. They were able to use the discussion board as a safe space to interact with one
        another and have an open conversation with peers that might not have been possible
        otherwise. Through thought-provoking questions and discussions, students’ learning was
        enhanced, and they gained an understanding of weighty subject matters such as systematic
        discrimination and police brutality.</p>
      <p>Integrating the specific texts and conversations into the curriculum afforded students the
        opportunity to learn and understand others’ lived experiences to benefit self, society,
        community, and culture. Time and again, I have argued that the African American genre is
        often overlooked or minimized. Too often, minority groups are underrepresented in mainstream
        culture, creating the illusion that only certain demographics are able to creatively
        participate in society. By teaching this genre to my students, I help them learn how great
        writers of all cultures and ethnicities can engage in meaningful dialogue through
        literature.</p>
      <p>The three chosen texts for this class granted students the chance to examine the ideologies
        that perpetuate oppression. Students evaluated the society they currently live in, but more
        important, students were able to reflect, identify, and become aware of their own personal
        biases in order to help make a change. Teaching students the importance of moving away from
        racial stereotypes and ideologies will help make them aware and, hopefully, lend a hand in
        creating an antiracist campus environment.</p>

      <p><span class="drop">W</span>hat does it mean to teach Native American history on a campus
        committed to antiracism when that commitment does not extend to Indigenous Peoples? Sure, at
        Geneseo we do a territorial acknowledgment at the beginning of formal campus events, and the
        Haudenosaunee flag hangs in a gallery of national flags in MacVittie College Union and on
        stage at commencement. My Intersession 2021 class was included in a menu of “Antiracism”
        courses at Geneseo. But we will not fly the flag on the official campus flag pole like many
        of our sister institutions, and we have yet to make a determined investment in recruiting
        Native American students. We have no Native American faculty.</p> <!--more-->
      <p>And there’s this: No other college in all of New York is more closely connected to the long
        history of systematic dispossession without which this state could not exist. Some are
        guiltier than others, but all who own property in our part of New York state are complicit.
        To me, our commitment to antiracism sometimes seems hollow and incomplete, more words than
        deeds.</p>
      <p>So I viewed this winter intersession as an opportunity to teach the problem, to make clear
        the tension between what we as a campus like to think we are, and what our conduct with
        regard to Indigenous peoples might show us to be. We started the semester with Chenussio,
        the largest Indigenous town ever to have existed in what is now New York State. Our campus
        stands in a town built hard by this important place. It was Seneca soldiers from Chenussio
        who contained European expansion on the margins of Iroquoia, who slaughtered British troops
        at the Devil’s Hole “Massacre” in 1763. Senecas from Chenussio and neighboring towns posed
        so great a threat to the proclaimed independence of the United States that in 1779 George
        Washington sent Continental forces against them with orders to burn their towns, destroy
        their fields and orchards, and destroy the basis of their subsistence. It was a “feed
        fight,” intended to drive the Senecas from their homes and transform them into refugees
        reliant on the British for food. Starvation was the goal, and George Washington hoped that
        the campaign would <a
          href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/03-21-02-0286">“destroy their
        Settlements &amp; extirpate them from the Country.”</a></p>
      <p>New York State did not have to tax its citizens for several decades after the Revolution.
        The sale of lands seized from Haudenosaunee peoples, often through fraudulent and at times
        illegal treaties, funded the operation of state government. And then there were the wealthy
        land speculators, who traded in the right to acquire Indigenous lands. The largest of those
        sales took place at Big Tree. There are state historic markers along the roads that pass
        through the campus identifying the sites where the Big Tree treaty took place. All of New
        York, west of the Genesee, was sold by Senecas in exchange for the payment of the interest
        on a hundred-thousand dollar investment in US Bank stock. No college in the United States
        stands on the actual site of a dispossession treaty of such magnitude.</p>
      <p>New York could not have become the Empire State without a systematic program of Iroquois
        dispossession. Our college, our community, our county — they all are central to that story.
        There are still Seneca communities in western New York, the ancestors of those whose
        dispossession and expulsion allowed Chenussio to become Geneseo. The Tonawanda Seneca
        Nation, still part of the broader Haudenosaunee, or Iroquois League, stands on land about
        fifty miles northwest of campus. The reservations belonging to the Seneca Nation of Indians
        are farther still to the west. If any number of New Yorkers throughout history had had their
        way, these Indigenous communities would no longer exist. Assaulted by imported disease,
        invaded by military forces, attacked on all sides by a settler state that carted off their
        children, attempted to eradicate their culture and language, appropriate their lands and
        destroy them as a people, theirs is a history that we have only recently become more
        comfortable talking about. That is not enough, some of my most thoughtful students told me
        as we approached the end of the session. We need to do more. History can impose obligations,
        I tell my students, and I hope the intersession class in some small way made these
        obligations more difficult to ignore.</p>

      <p><span class="drop">I</span> have taught Politics of the Judicial Process five times while
        at Geneseo. To keep my interest, and hopefully student interest, I change the emphasis
        fairly often. When Michelle Alexander’s <em>The New Jim Crow</em> came out, I used it. In
        the same class I employed Brandon Garrett’s <em>Too Big To Jail</em>. The juxtaposition of
        Black incarceration and all its negative effects on one hand, and white corporate America
        paying a fine out of corporate coffers on the other, made for an interesting learning
        experience for students.</p> <!--more-->
      <p>More recently, I became interested in the intersection of law and psychiatry. I quickly add
        that I am neither a lawyer nor a psychiatrist. However, I just thought that the way the
        legal system treats mental illness is seriously flawed. I used Ellsworth Fersch’s <em>Thinking
        About the Insanity Defense</em> (a bit dated) and Kevin Davis’s <em>The Brain Defense</em>.
        Articles from both Penn and Vanderbilt are available as both schools are leaders in
        “neurolaw.”</p>
      <p>Given all that has occurred over the last few years, including the murder of George Floyd,
        I thought it was necessary to incorporate law and race into my Fall 2020 course. I then
        compressed it into an intersession course. Frankly, at the time I wasn’t much aware of
        Geneseo’s effort on race. It just seemed to be the right time to employ race.</p>
      <p>I began the course with an historic review of race in America. I used Jill Lepore’s “Long
        Blue Line” and David Blight’s “An American Pogrom.” Both are excellent works showing how
        policing itself began with slave control (Lepore) and how initial Black political power
        during the post-Civil War era was brutally put down.</p>
      <p>Then I used two books: Timothy Tyson’s <em>The Blood of Emmett Till</em> and an edited work
        by Angela Davis entitled <em>Policing the Black Man</em>. I interspersed the books with two
        Supreme Court Cases (<em>Terry v. Ohio</em> and <em>Whren v. US</em>) and several articles.
        I recommend both works. The Tyson book had a huge impact on students as “southern justice”
        is emphatically exposed in all its brutality. The author argues convincingly that the Till
        murder directly galvanized the civil rights movement. It’s a nice connection to the more
        traditional civil rights movement and to Black Lives Matter. I did not have time, but I
        suggested to students that they watch filmmaker David Beauchamp’s <a
          href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0475420/">
          <em>
            <span class="underline">The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till</span>
          </em>
        </a>.
        It puts an agonizing face on all the people involved.</p>
      <p>The Davis book presents the legal structure itself and its impact on Black people. By
        utilizing eleven articles, the book allows me to fulfill my obligation to teach students the
        structure itself, while at the same time noting the impact of the structure on Black men. In
        addition, I use various articles not in the book to present systemic racism, the Black
        response (BLM), police blowback and possible reform.</p>
      <p>I had no tests. Rather, the students had to write a literature review using both books, the
        articles, and cases. I like this approach for two reasons. It makes students read the
        assigned material and display a deep and sophisticated understanding (my instructions). And
        it preserves the integrity of the course. While I required 15 pages, all were over 20 and
        three reached 30. To me, this indicated strong student interest in the subject.</p>
      <p>Keeping with the college’s initiative to become an antiracist campus, my course was able to
        raise and sustain student consciousness concerning the intersection of race and the law.
        This was my purpose in the first place. The Till book had an especially strong impact. Of
        course, with only eight in the class, it was much easier to achieve.</p>
      <p>I learned much from the students. Four or five are deeply involved in BLM and human rights.
        They enlivened the class and informed me with their personal stories all connected to their
        involvement with race.</p>
      <p>The problem with the subject matter is highlighted by a simple question that students
        raised toward the end of the course. I had heard it when I taught the course in the fall.
        “What do we do now?” This is difficult to answer in an academic setting where thought
        receives more emphasis than action, where listening to NPR is more important than being on
        the streets. But it needs to be answered and acted upon lest we lose the opportunity for
        change.</p>
      <p>So, my course sustained the College’s efforts within an academic setting. It did seem to
        encourage and sustain some student action. This is good.</p>

      <p><span class="drop">A</span>s a social scientist teaching Environmental Issues (ENVR 124), I
        have a lot of fun disrupting students’ perspectives of what constitutes “the environment.”
        Students typically come into my class expecting to spend the bulk of their time exploring
        ecological concepts and problems, but they quickly learn that much of the course focuses on
        digging into the relationships between humans and our surroundings. By positioning
        Environmental Issues as an explicitly antiracist course for the 2021 intersession, I took
        these connections further to examine the impacts of power relations and economic structures.
        I encouraged my students to consider “environmental issues” as components of broader
        socio-ecological systems and to conceptualize the implications of such problems for
        questions of sustainability and justice.</p> <!--more-->
      <h2 id="starting-on-the-same-page">Starting on the same page</h2>
      <p>I grounded Environmental Issues in two assumptions introduced at the very beginning of the
        course. First, climate change is real, happening right now, and is human-caused. Second,
        ecological degradation and climate change are intricately linked with social injustices,
        which often manifest along racial lines. These two assumptions simultaneously ensured that
        the whole class started on the same page, pushed students to reconceptualize their
        interpretations of “the environment,” and laid out a values system that the rest of the
        course built on. However, in stating these assumptions, I also invited debate and discussion
        around them, noting that students might not share the same assumptions and that grappling
        with these assumptions is a critical part of the learning process. As I discuss below,
        actually creating opportunities for such debate and discussion was made difficult by the
        asynchronous nature of the course.</p>
      <h2 id="a-modular-approach">A modular approach</h2>
      <p>I divided the course into four, one-week modules. The first introduced students to core
        concepts, such as sustainability, climate change, and ecosystems. The second and third
        integrated these concepts into topics and issues, including biodiversity, minerals, water,
        energy, food, and urbanization. The fourth applied the lessons learned in the first three
        modules by explicitly situating them as socio-ecological systems that humans continuously
        influence and are influenced by: health and the environment, environmental governance, and
        transformations and solutions. As we progressed through these course modules, I increasingly
        integrated concepts of social (in)justice such that students simultaneously developed an
        understanding of the complexities of socio-ecological systems and the ways in which these
        systems contribute to oppression, exploitation, and uneven power relations. Specifically, we
        moved from learning about how environmental systems and humans interact, to thinking about
        how the impacts of these interactions vary depending on location and populace, to analyzing
        these impacts through an environmental justice lens, to drawing out the racial injustices
        inherent in today’s socio-ecological systems.</p>
      <p>Class assignments reflected this progression. Starting with an assignment designed to
        ensure that students engaged critical thinking skills throughout their coursework, students
        were asked to distinguish between credible sources and “<a
          href="https://www.getbadnews.com/#intro">fake news</a>.” Subsequent assignments asked them
        to think critically about deforestation in the rainforest and citizen science projects, and
        to trace the possible supply chain for one item that they owned. (For example: What minerals
        went into making your computer and what were the socio-ecological implications from mining
        those minerals?) As we progressed into explicitly examining social and racial injustices, we
        dug into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZmxEY6QoUY">Cape Town’s water crisis</a>,
        the social implications of agriculture subsidies in the US, the disparate health impacts of
        Covid-19 on Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) communities, and the role of
        grassroots movements in addressing socio-ecological issues.</p>
      <h2 id="aha-moments">“Aha!” moments</h2>
      <p>I had taught this course in a very similar manner in fall 2020, but I was in person with my
        students for the majority of that semester. Because my teaching style is very
        discussion-based, I found that students in the fall developed a deep understanding of the
        socio-ecological issues we were learning about by working through questions and concerns
        together as a class and by being exposed to and learning to incorporate multiple
        perspectives and lived experiences. However, I found this type of learning experience
        extremely difficult to replicate through an asynchronous online course.</p>
      <p>I offered weekly optional discussion hours, where students could choose to join a group
        discussion via Zoom rather than writing reflections and posting them to discussion boards.
        These discussions always started with responses to specific questions, such as, “Do you
        think that industrial agriculture results in a net benefit or net harm for humans today and
        in the future?” or “Why is environmental justice important to consider when devising
        solutions to environmental issues?” But answering these questions always diverted us to
        talking about other issues, such as specific instances of injustice that someone has
        witnessed at home, or who is left out of environmental justice efforts. These discussion
        hours were my favorite part of teaching this course. Witnessing the “Aha!” moments, such as
        a student’s connecting an environmental issue to today’s economic system to injustices
        witnessed at home, is incredibly rewarding.</p>
      <p>Yet I only had two to three students out of 13 join most of the discussion hours. In
        comparing the assignment submissions of those who attended the group discussions to those
        who did not, I found that those who attended began to make connections and draw insights
        that the other students were struggling with.</p>
      <h2 id="concluding-thoughts">Concluding thoughts</h2>
      <p>The outcomes of this informal comparison make sense: linking environmental issues with
        social injustices and thinking critically about the causes and impacts of such
        socio-ecological systems are ways of thinking that many are unused to, and learning how to
        think in these ways is a process. Being able to work through related questions and concerns
        with other students and learning from each other are, I believe, extremely important parts
        of this process. Because not all students took part in the group discussion hours, I believe
        that many students did not develop as complete an understanding of the interconnections
        between environmental issues and social and racial injustices as I hoped that they would.
        Therefore, in the future, I would prefer to have at a minimum a required synchronous
        component to this class to ensure that all students have the opportunity to undergo the
        process of understanding these important connections and implications.</p>

      <p><span class="drop">F</span>or as long as I can remember, I have been a baseball fan. And
        not just a baseball fan, but a Dodger fan. Watching Dodger games on television and attending
        games at Dodger Stadium was a memorable part of my upbringing in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>I don’t remember when I first learned about Jackie Robinson. He is, of course, known for
        breaking the color line in baseball: the first Black ballplayer in the major leagues in the
        twentieth century. But he’s also a Dodger legend. So I’ve long taken pride that my team —
        the Dodgers — was the team that began to break down segregation in baseball.</p> <!--more-->
      <p>As I grew older and became a historian, specializing in the history of African Americans, I
        still maintained my love of Dodger baseball, but I kept it in a separate realm. I was a fan.
        I enjoyed baseball; I didn’t study it. But then the pandemic began, almost one year ago now,
        and it disrupted practices and assumptions. Like many people, I struggled with the lockdown
        and grew frustrated with the hours of isolation from friends, extended family, and public
        spaces.</p>
      <p>Baseball, however, provided some solace. I watched baseball on TV as the MLB attempted an
        unprecedented and abbreviated schedule that included less than half the regularly scheduled
        games and new protocols to limit the spread of Covid-19. Despite the unusual season, it all
        turned out well for my Dodgers. They won the 2020 World Series and provided me with a
        wonderful diversion from the harshness of pandemic life.</p>
      <h2 id="an-idea-for-a-course">An idea for a course</h2>
      <p>As the Dodgers were making their way through the playoffs in early October, I began to
        think that a course on sports might make for an interesting intersession offering. I had
        never taught an intersession course before. I had never taught a fully online course before,
        and I also had not taught sports history. Then again, I had never experienced a lockdown
        before, used Zoom, or worn a face mask in public. Things were changing. For such a short
        period of time — four weeks — I thought that a course built around one person might provide
        a workable structure, and I could think of no one better to focus on than Jackie Robinson.</p>
      <p>I had a general understanding of Robinson when I proposed the course, but as I read more I
        realized that I could use his life (1919-1972) as a framework to understand the history of
        American racism in the twentieth century. He was born in the Jim Crow South, like most
        African Americans before 1915. His mother fled sharecropping in Georgia to settle in
        Pasadena, California, much like millions of other Black people who moved to northern and
        western cities during the Great Migration. After college, Robinson enlisted in the army
        during World War II and challenged the segregated military. After the war, in 1947, he broke
        into major league baseball with the Brooklyn Dodgers.</p>
      <p>Ten years later, with his hall of fame career established, he retired. This is usually
        where the story of Jackie Robinson ends. Instead, I learned that his retirement years were
        often as interesting as his playing years. Robinson jumped into politics. He raised money
        for and marched with civil rights groups. He joined political campaigns and wrote a weekly
        newspaper column, not about sports but about politics and the Black experience. I learned
        that Robinson’s breaking of the color line in 1947 was just one instance of a lifetime of
        civil rights activism. And I realized that a course focusing on Jackie Robinson could
        contribute to Geneseo’s effort to become an antiracist campus.</p>
      <h2 id="baseball-as-a-prism">Baseball as a prism</h2>
      <p>I titled the course Jackie Robinson, Baseball, and American Racism. I told my students that
        we would examine his life and times in order to better understand racism and antiracism in
        American history. “Although this course will focus mostly on Robinson as a baseball player,”
        I mentioned in the syllabus, “it will use baseball as a prism to engage with historical
        developments in the twentieth century, such as Jim Crow, the Cold War, the Civil Rights
        Movement, and the intersection of sports, politics, and culture.”</p>
      <p>To my surprise, the course filled up quickly. Students seemed interested in a course on
        sports and also somewhat interested in Jackie Robinson. They were even more interested in an
        upper-level course during the intersession that met required elements for the History major.
        Nonetheless, they were game to join my experiment in offering a course on a topic that I had
        never taught previously or in such a condensed and online format.</p>
      <p>I filled out the course with a long list of readings and assignments. I assigned five
        books, eighteen articles, and an array of other primary source documents. Students had to
        write daily discussion posts, a comparative film essay, a reflective essay, and a series of
        assignments leading up to a 15-page research paper. I was asking a lot from the students,
        but it was also a 400-level course. All of the reading and writing gave us the opportunity
        to have informed and stimulating synchronous discussions twice a week. The discussions built
        on extensive discussion posts in which students explored the creation of the color line in
        baseball, the extensive campaign among leftist groups and individuals to end segregation,
        Robinson’s persistent denunciations of racist policies and actions, and many other topics.
        We often connected the history with the present, noting how similar Robinson was, for
        example, to Colin Kaepernick.</p>
      <p>For the research project, every student wrote about the struggle against racism. Most chose
        a sports figure. Some examined the ways that racism contributed to other forms of exclusion.
        This project gave students an opportunity to explore antiracism in their own way, and I
        think that they each gained valuable insight from it. On the other hand, it was very
        difficult to create an original research project in less than four weeks. Most students
        lamented the constraints they faced in locating online sources and finding time to research
        while keeping up with the other course expectations. Nevertheless, they all completed the
        research papers on time.</p>
      <h2 id="is-knowledge-enough">Is knowledge enough?</h2>
      <p>Overall, the course was a great experience. The students were engaged and worked hard. I
        missed having them in a classroom and I wish I could have gotten to know them better, but it
        was a successful online intersession course. During our last meeting, a few students
        suggested that I expand the course beyond Jackie Robinson and baseball if I were to teach it
        during a 16-week semester. I see the value in their critique. This course could be
        reconceptualized as one that engages racism in sports more broadly (in boxing and football,
        for instance) and one that addresses other barriers in sports, specifically gender and
        sexuality. Indeed, I learned that sports offer a discursive framework that might enable
        better discussions on inequities and inequalities. It is a prism, as I mentioned in the
        syllabus, to explore significant political and cultural issues.</p>
      <p>More specifically, I have been reflecting on how my course did and did not engage with
        antiracism. On the one hand, the course could be considered antiracist because much of the
        content addressed historical efforts to mitigate racist policies. But is antiracist content
        enough? I’ve taught African American history for many years now, but I’ve never identified
        my courses as “antiracist.” All of my courses grapple with the history of racism and the
        effects of racist policies on people’s lives. So, why haven’t I called it this before?</p>
      <p>During my <a
          href="](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Jackie_Robinson,_Brooklyn_Dodgers,_1954.jpg)">Teaching
        and Learning Center</a> presentation on my course, <a
          href="https://events.geneseo.edu/event/rethinking_abolitionism_and_the_history_of_racism#.YD1j5WhKiHs">“Teaching
        Antiracism through Sports History and Jackie Robinson,”</a> my colleague Crystal Simmons
        asked an interesting question. She wondered if I had noticed any shifts among my students in
        their beliefs or understandings about race or racism. I mentioned a few anecdotal
        interactions that somewhat answered the question. Reflecting on this question later, I
        realized that I didn’t really know if the course had changed a student’s understanding of
        racism partly because I didn’t set up the course that way. I didn’t include, for example, a
        learning outcome on antiracism. As is typical of 400-level History courses, I included our
        skills-focused learning outcomes, but I hadn’t considered what an antiracist objective would
        look like. And I’m still not sure what one would be. I think it would need to be more than
        just an acknowledgement that students will become aware of racism and antiracism. Knowledge
        is a good first step, but is it enough? In many ways, antiracism is a value, not a skill and
        not necessarily content. If antiracism is a value, how then do we construct learning
        outcomes that meet a set of values? Perhaps some of my colleagues in other disciplines have
        already tackled this issue. One thing this course has taught me is that I need to learn more
        about how to be more intentionally antiracist in course design, not just in content.</p>

      <p><span class="drop">I</span> am a relational communication teacher-scholar and a growth
        seeker. At the heart of my teaching is a value for dialogue, which is a unique communication
        process that prioritizes multivocality, listening, reflection, and connection.</p>
      <p>When I was presented with the opportunity to support the college’s value of inclusion
        through integrating antiracist content into my January 2021 intersession online course, I
        quickly jumped at the chance knowing that the process would foster my personal and
        professional growth. With feelings of excitement and apprehension, I began the work.</p> <!--more-->
      <p><em>What course should I choose?</em> Intercultural Communication. It is a perfect fit.</p>
      <p><em>In what unit should I integrate content on antiracism?</em> The unit on “Histories and
        Identities” seemed right since in this unit we explore various identities, the relationship
        between history and identity, and the role of communication in various identity-related
        experiences. Exploring the role of communication in antiracism seemed like a natural
        extension.</p>
      <p><em>What is my goal?</em> With one of my favorite quotes from Maya Angelou in mind (and on
        my syllabus) — “Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do
        better” — I knew I wanted to equip us to do better, personally, relationally, and as members
        of multiple systems including the Geneseo community.</p>
      <p><em>How will I accomplish my goal?</em> With apprehension, I pondered: <em>How can I do
          this in a way that is mindful, supportive, respectful, engaging, meaningful, and
        growth-promoting when I am situated within my own identities? How can I do this when I also
        have so much to learn?</em></p>
      <p>I knew I wanted to maintain the module structure that I use throughout the course. After
        providing an overview, I ask students to engage deeply with a variety of texts, build and
        demonstrate topic-centered vocabulary, engage in dialogue, and synthesize materials in the
        form of an assignment.</p>
      <p>I started with the basics.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I incorporated additional texts. I introduced them to <a

          Center</a>.</li>
        <li>I centered relevant concepts in my overview and quiz (in retrospect, I could have done
          this better).</li>
        <li>I adjusted the discussion prompts to include a specific focus on the role of
          communication in racism and antiracism.</li>
        <li>I chose to keep the synthesis assignment the same since it involves a narrative
          reflection about identity.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Yet, I knew something more was needed.</p>
      <p>As I continued to wonder, <em>How can I do this in a way that is mindful, supportive,
        respectful, engaging, meaningful, and growth promoting when I am situated within my own
        identities? How can I do this when I also have so much to learn?,</em> other questions that
        I had been pondering for semesters joined them. <em>How can I encourage richer discussion
        responses</em> — <em>ones that go beyond compliments and expressions of agreement? How can I
        encourage students to engage with every post for its value rather than limiting themselves
          to the one to which they feel confident responding? How can I move beyond valuing a growth
        mindset to actually supporting it?</em></p>
      <p>These questions led me to reflect: <em>When do I experience the most meaningful learning
          and the most significant growth?</em> <em>Why am I frustrated with the quality of
        discussion
          responses? How do I want or expect responses to function?</em></p>
      <p>Then it hit me. I realized that I wasn’t using the discussion forum for its full potential.
        My current strategy wasn’t aligned with my value for dialogue and my goal of supporting a
        growth mindset. I began to wonder: <em>What if I made a small adjustment and changed the
        requirement from submitting a post and a response</em> (which has been my process for years) <em>to
        submitting an initial post and a repost</em> (what I am currently calling a “growth post”)<em>
        ?</em> <em>Could this small change shift students’ perspective from “What can I teach you?”
          to “What did you teach me?” Might this small change encourage students to broaden and
        deepen
          their listening? Might the small change showcase that our perspectives are situated in
        time
          and space and have the potential to develop and grow and change with more knowledge and
        deeper reflection? Might this small change illustrate that we all have things to learn?
          Might this small change normalize the progressive quality of learning? Might learning
        about
          others’ growth inspire even more reflection and potentially even more growth?</em> <strong>
          <em>Could a small change really make a big difference?</em>
        </strong></p>
      <p>With hope and optimism, I tried it. I found the growth posts to be richer and more personal
        than the response posts I received in past semesters. I saw students acknowledging points
        they had previously overlooked. I witnessed students confirming the value of each other’s
        voice. It seemed like a good decision.</p>
      <p>What did this opportunity teach me?</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Aligning values, goals, and choices is important but not always easy.</li>
        <li>Reflection is necessary for growth.</li>
        <li>We are all teachers and learners.</li>
        <li>Even the smallest change can make a big difference.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>I hope my students learned these lessons, too!</p>

        <em>Editor’s note: During the January 2021 Intersession, as part of Geneseo’s project of <a
            href="https://www.geneseo.edu/tlc/becoming-antiracist-college-project">becoming an
          antiracist college</a>, nearly a dozen faculty taught courses that either focused
          centrally on issues of racial justice or incorporated those issues via dedicated modules
          and interwoven content. Professor Medeiros’s post is the first in a series in which
          faculty reflect on their objectives and experience in these courses.</em>
      </p>
      <p><span class="drop">C</span>ontemporary cultural anthropologists such as myself must grapple
        with the problematic and racist legacy of our discipline’s founders who were complicit in
        the creation of race as a category and the normalization of racism. For me, overcoming this
        legacy has meant creating lessons and entire courses that contribute to antiracism efforts
        in our society and on our campus. In the course Race, Racism and the Black Experience in the
        Americas, students are introduced to the ways in which race is socially and culturally
        constructed not just in the United States but in countries across the Americas. They learn
        that although the construction of race is not universal, white privilege and the
        marginalization of people who are racially marked as “Black” exists in sociocultural
        contexts throughout North, Central, and South America and the Caribbean.</p> <!--more-->
      <p>In learning about the experiences and perspectives of Black people in different contexts,
        students start to recognize the ways in which the legacy of colonialism, slavery, and
        scientific racism continues to endure and manifests in systemic racism and structural
        violence. Students also learn about local and transnational Black social movements that work
        to address systemic racism. The course was also designed to help students draw connections
        between the course content and their own efforts at becoming antiracist and transforming
        Geneseo into an antiracist campus. From the course introduction module, where antiracism is
        introduced, to the content of future modules and assignments, students are asked to consider
        the ways in which what they are learning can be applied on their campuses and in their
        lives.</p>
      <p>After teaching this course in person as part of Geneseo’s study abroad programs in <a
          href="https://suny-geneseo-horizons.symplicity.com/index.php?s=programs&amp;mode=form&amp;id=76aeb053a8bfe5a8ccfc00daf5475745">
        Brazil</a> and <a
          href="https://suny-geneseo-horizons.symplicity.com/?s=programs&amp;mode=form&amp;id=924d9363c61214fe2fae33bfa29fd364">
        Cuba</a>, transforming it into an online course required me to think of ways for students to
        learn the material and from one another without the transformative experience of being in a
        small group in a foreign country. One strategy that worked surprisingly well was to put
        students into small discussion groups (5-7 students) and require them to post to discussion
        boards at the end of each module. I gave the students very specific guidelines for posting.
        Their initial post had to include introductory sentences referring to the assigned reading
        and films, and then a discussion question. Students were required to then respond to the
        discussion questions posted by their group members.</p>
      <p>Lastly, students were required to comment on their group members’ responses to the question
        they posted to complete the exchange. I was pleasantly surprised by the richness and depth
        of the discussions the students had. They posed interesting questions and were respectful
        and thoughtful in their exchanges. Many of the students described how what they were
        learning in the course would influence their interactions on campus and in their future
        careers. While discussion boards are no replacement for in-person dialogue, they were a good
        substitute. For some students who may not have been comfortable with participating actively
        in in-person discussions, the discussion board posts afforded them the opportunity to engage
        with their classmates on issues and topics that are often uncomfortable for students to
        discuss.</p>
      <p>In an ideal scenario, this course would be taught over the course of a regular semester,
        with more opportunities for in-person discussion on the course material, current events, and
        Geneseo’s campus climate. However, considering that this course was taught remotely over a
        4-week period I was impressed by the students’ engagement with the material and ability to
        apply it to their own experiences and Geneseo’s context through their discussion board
        posts. In some ways, the intensity of a four-week intersession during which they were fully
        committed to the course, without other courses competing for their time, facilitated their
        dedication to the course’s materials and goals.</p>

      <p><span class="drop">T</span>he Center for Digital Learning and the SUNY Geneseo <a
          href="https://www.geneseo.edu/sa">Student Association</a> are excited to invite members of
        the campus community — students, faculty, and staff — to a conversation about student
        workload in online courses.</p>
      <p>The Zoom event, which requires <a
          href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://geneseo.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJ0uf--urj8oGdalCe4LqPfU-tukMrOtq0aZ&amp;sa=D&amp;source=calendar&amp;ust=1615822468144000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3hn3hFSSbnXuMUH-NiiHCI">
        registration</a>, will be held Thursday, March 18, 1:45 — 2:45 p.m. Participation is limited
        to the first 150 registrants.</p> <!--more-->
      <p>The pandemic has been hard on everyone. Fear of illness, the reality of illness (one’s own,
        a friend’s, a family member’s), and the consequences of both (including depression,
        disruption, and even death) have formed the background to a range of other challenges,
        including — for both students and faculty on our largely residential campus, with its focus
        on lively, face-to-face interaction in physical spaces — recalibrating our daily schedules
        and recalculating the time and effort required for learning when learning must happen in
        virtual spaces such as Zoom and Canvas.</p>
      <p>Hard as it’s been, though, the pandemic has also created a valuable opportunity to
        re-examine old assumptions and move forward in better ways. We need to ask what the past
        year can teach us about the relationship between coursework and learning. When we return to
        in-person instruction at Geneseo next fall, are there lessons we can carry forward that
        improve every student’s educational experience, whether in the physically present classroom
        or in the occasional post-pandemic online course that students will likely appreciate having
        as an option to give them greater autonomy and flexibility?</p>
      <p>We also need, urgently, to figure out what we can do <em>now</em> to make sure every
        Geneseo student has tools and strategies for completing the spring 2021 semester
        successfully.</p>
      <p>The March 18 meeting will be an opportunity for students, faculty, and staff to engage in
        collaborative problem-solving, to generate concrete suggestions for increasing transparency
        around workload expectations and flexibility in the design and scheduling of assignments.</p>
      <p>But even before the problem-solving begins, students will have a chance simply to share,
        anonymously, how the workload during this past year of pandemic learning has felt to them.
        This lived experience must be the starting point for any effort to think in new ways about
        learning objectives, the work required to achieve them, and the challenge of designing
        courses with an eye toward values such as compassion and equity.</p>
      <p>Last December, Jody Greene, Associate Vice Provost for Teaching and Learning and Director
        of the Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning at the University of California,
        Santa Cruz, wrote a piece for <em>Inside Higher Education</em> titled <a
          href="https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/just-visiting/guest-post-strange-case-exploding-student-workload">“The
        Strange Case of the Exploding Student Workload.”</a> What was strange — in fact, paradoxical
        — about the explosion she witnessed last fall, she suggested, was that “the more [that
        well-intentioned faculty] tried to design with student well-being in mind, according to
        principles widely accepted as appropriate to support learning and diminish stress —
        principles such as breaking assignments into smaller pieces, distributing assessments across
        the length of the quarter and helping students stay engaged — the more students told them
        they were overwhelmed by the workload.”</p>
      <p>As I said, the pandemic has been hard on everyone — hardest, perhaps, when our best effort
        to fulfill our obligations to our work and to each other hasn’t produced the effect we
        sought.</p>
      <p>With an abundance of good will, students and faculty at Geneseo have been making their best
        effort and then some. But good will alone won’t solve the paradox. We need to talk, we need
        to think together, we need to find solutions. March 18 will be a chance to do all three.</p>

        recognition technology fails to see dark-skinned faces, how biases of various kinds find
        their way into computer algorithms, and what citizens can do to fight algorithmic injustice.</p>
      <p>It’s been available this week for Geneseo campus community members to stream for free as
        part of the college’s <a href="https://events.geneseo.edu/black_history_month">line-up of
        events for Black History Month</a>.</p> <!--more-->
      <p>Tomorrow, our community can also meet the director of <em>Coded Bias</em>, <a
          href="https://www.shalinikantayya.net/">Shalini Kantayaa</a>, who will join us virtually
        to discuss the film and answer questions. Registering for the Q&amp;A session will get you a
        link to watch the film.</p>
      <p>Together, the screening and visit provide an excellent opportunity to address Geneseo’s
        stance on a hotly debated topic in education right now: online exam proctoring. Although
        proctoring isn’t a focus of Kantayya’s film, it uses some of the same methods that the film
        scrutinizes and raises the same issues that lie at the film’s moral and political heart:
        issues at the intersection of technology, privacy, autonomy, equity, and social justice.</p>
      <p>Geneseo’s decision not to pay for online proctoring services reflects a conviction that
        these services run afoul of the college’s values and of its recently articulated <a
          href="https://www.geneseo.edu/tlc/becoming-antiracist-college-project">commitment to
        antiracism</a>.</p>
      <h2 id="proctoring-and-the-pandemic">Proctoring and the pandemic</h2>
      <p>When the Covid-19 pandemic forced much of higher education online last spring, concern
        immediately erupted that students would take advantage of the remote environment to cheat. A
        new study published in the <em>International Journal for Educational Technology</em>,
        covered just this month in <em>
          <a
            href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2021/02/05/study-finds-nearly-200-percent-jump-questions-submitted-chegg-after-start-pandemic">Inside
        Higher Ed</a>
        </em>, lends some validity to that concern by linking the move online
        to a spike in activity on the website Chegg. On its “About” page, Chegg describes itself as
        a “student-first connected learning platform,” but as the study’s authors point out, it also
        provides an easy way for students to “breach academic integrity by obtaining outside help”
        on assignments or exams they’re expected to complete on their own.</p>
      <p>One tool designed to prevent online exam cheating was already available when the concern
        arose: commercial services that use students’ own computers to monitor their activity while
        they work. Companies such as ProctorU, Proctorio, Examity, Honorlock, and Respondus either
        allow a live proctor to watch a student through the student’s camera or capture video of the
        student and run it through an algorithm to detect evidence of cheating.</p>
      <h2 id="big-brother-is-watching-u">Big Brother is watching U.</h2>
      <p>In April, <a
          href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/01/online-proctoring-college-exams-coronavirus/">an
        article in the <em>Washington Post</em></a> put its finger on one problem with online
        proctoring right in the headline: the pandemic, it declared, was “driving a new wave of
        student surveillance.”</p>
      <p>Perhaps the most important word in that headline was “new.” Just a few months earlier, the <em>
        Post</em> had described how <a
          href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/12/24/colleges-are-turning-students-phones-into-surveillance-machines-tracking-locations-hundreds-thousands/">“Colleges
        are turning students’ phones into surveillance machines, tracking the locations of hundreds
        of thousands”</a>.</p>
      <p>The problem with using what critics routinely call “spyware” to enforce academic integrity
        — or even simply nudge students toward better academic performance — goes beyond the culture
        of surveillance it creates and promotes; it touches equally on the question on who profits
        from that surveillance. As <a
          href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/seanlawson/2020/04/24/are-schools-forcing-students-to-install-spyware-that-invades-their-privacy-as-a-result-of-the-coronavirus-lockdown/?sh=d9b9d2e638d8">
          <em>Forbes</em>
        </a> reported last spring, some University of California Santa
        Barbara faculty raised a red flag as early as March about “ProctorU’s data collection,
        retention, and sharing practices.” Spyware that monetizes student data, like all forms of
        what Harvard Business School professor Shoshana Zuboff calls <a
          href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/04/shoshana-zuboff-surveillance-capitalism-assault-human-automomy-digital-privacy">“surveillance
        capitalism”</a>, turns students into the raw material for a new kind of commodity, in the
        process depriving them not only of privacy but autonomy.</p>
      <h2 id="algorithmic-injustice">Algorithmic injustice</h2>
      <p>In December 2019, the <em>New York Times</em> reported on a study by the National Institute
        of Standards and Technology that <a
          href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/19/technology/facial-recognition-bias.html">showed
        most commercial facial recognition systems are biased</a>, falsely identifying African
        American and Asian faces at rates 10 to 100 times greater than white ones, and exhibiting
        the highest error rates when identifying Native Americans. The systems in the study also had
        more difficulty identifying women than men and identifying older adults than middle-aged
        ones.</p>
      <p>Earlier that same year, Nijeer Parks, a Black man, had been arrested on suspicion of
        shoplifting and trying to assault a police officer at a Hampton Inn in Woodbridge, NJ.
        Although miles from the location of the incident when it happened, Parks had been falsely
        identified as the perpetrator through the use of facial recognition technology. He became
        the third Black man in the U.S. known to have been incorrectly arrested based on flawed
        facial recognition.</p>
      <p>The following year, the <em>Times</em> reported on the facial recognition company Clearview
        AI, branding it <a
          href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html">“The
        Secretive Company that Might End Privacy as We Know It”</a> and pointing out that “without
        public scrutiny, more than 600 law enforcement agencies have started using Clearview in the
        past year.” The article noted the tendency of the company’s software to produce false
        matches.</p>
      <p>At the end of 2020, a year after the <em>Times</em> had first reported on the Parks case,
        Parks sued the police, the prosecutor, and the City of Woodbridge for false arrest, false
        imprisonment, and violation of his civil rights.</p>
      <p>Clearview AI’s facial recognition app had been used in his case.</p>
      <h2 id="coded-bias">Coded bias</h2>
      <p>The “AI” in Clearview’s name stands for “artificial intelligence,” the broad class of
        software processes and products based on the ability of computers to learn on their own
        rather than follow a predetermined algorithm. One way they can learn is by working
        repetitively through reams of data and gradually improving their ability to perform the task
        that’s been set for them.</p>
      <p>This process — also known as “machine learning” — may sound like one of pure logic, freed
        from the flawed judgments, unexamined prejudices, and social privilege of the humans who set
        it in motion, but it’s not. Well before the federal government’s report on the racial bias
        built into facial recognition, alarms were sounding about the use of AI in a growing list of
        contexts, including lending, real estate, hiring, internet search, and the criminal justice
        system. Books such as <em>Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and
        Threatens Democracy</em> (2016), by Cathy O’Neil, and <em>Algorithms of Oppression: How
        Search Engines Reinforce Racism</em> (2018), by Safiya Noble, explained how machine learning
        algorithms can encode not only the bias of the coders who write them but the systemic
        inequities underlying the data on which the algorithms are trained.</p>
      <p>Similar concerns were raised by an MIT graduate student, Joy Buolamwini — the protagonist
        of <em>Coded Bias</em> — who discovered that she had to put on a white mask to get a facial
        recognition system to see her face. She gave a <a
          href="https://www.ted.com/talks/joy_buolamwini_how_i_m_fighting_bias_in_algorithms">TEDTalk
        on her ensuing research</a> that drew a large audience (views to date: 1,363,950), and she
        founded the <a href="https://www.ajl.org/">Algorithmic Justice League</a>, aimed at
        “building a movement to shift the AI ecosystem towards equitable and accountable AI.”</p>
      <p>In 2018, Buolamwini and AI researcher Timnit Gebru, then at Microsoft, published <a
          href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a/buolamwini18a.pdf">“Gender Shades:
        Intersectional Accuracy Disparities in Commercial Gender Classification”</a> in <em>Proceedings
        of Machine Learning</em>. Buolamwini and Gebru tested facial recognition systems developed
        by IBM, Microsoft, and Megvii of China against a data set of 1,270 diverse faces and found a
        huge disparity between the systems’ error rates when recognizing lighter-skinned males and
        darker-skinned women, respectively.</p>
      <h2 id="a-question-of-integrity">A question of integrity</h2>
      <p>Since proctoring software may rely on facial recognition, its potential harms include not
        only loss of privacy and autonomy, then, but also discrimination.</p>
      <p>Just this month, in fact, concern over the disparate impact of facial recognition
        technology on women and people of color led the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under
        Law to <a
          href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/civil-rights-group-threatens-suit-over-bar-exam-facial-scans">threaten
        suit against the State Bar of California</a> unless it stops using the technology to help
        prevent cheating by students taking the bar exam online.</p>
      <p>As <a
          href="https://www.eff.org/files/2020/12/08/2020.12.3_senate_letter_to_ed_testing_software_companies_examsoft.pdf">six
        U.S. senators point out in a letter</a> to the CEO of the company providing monitoring for
        the bar exam, students from a variety of institutions, across a range of testing situations,
        have reported unsettling instances of technology-based discrimination, including being
        unrecognizable to the software because of religious dress (such as a headscarf) and being
        flagged as “suspicious” because of a disability or other physical condition.</p>
      <p>The legal challenges to online proctoring are sure to grow, and as they do, colleges and
        universities that have subscribed to proctoring services may well change their minds about
        the tradeoff between the integrity of their values and the value of these services to secure
        the academic integrity of their students.</p>
      <p>But no institution of higher learning that promotes itself as student-centered,
        equity-minded, community-driven, pledged to antiracism, committed to justice for the
        marginalized and underrepresented, and organized to produce independent-thinking, autonomous
        graduates should require a legal challenge in order to reject a flawed and biased
        surveillance technology as its guarantor of honesty and fairness.</p>
      <p>Not that honesty and fairness don’t matter — these, too are important educational values.
        And not that cheating isn’t a geniune problem. But there are ways to foster honesty and
        obtain fairness that not only avoid sacrificing other values but are also, arguably, more
        conducive to learning.</p>
      <p>These other approaches seek to give students less reason for cheating to begin with. I’ll
        write about them in a future post. They’re preferable by far to the surveillance approach
        that Geneseo has wisely refused.</p>

          our student affiliates. As part of their work in the center, CDL student affiliates are
          encouraged to explore matters related to digital learning that interest them, and to

      </p>
      <p><span class="drop">T</span>he spring and fall semesters of 2020 presented many challenges
        to students and faculty, and we were resilient: we changed in response to the mounting
        challenges, and kept changing. We adapted to modes of digital learning that have become
        familiar to us since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus last spring, like
        video-conferencing on Zoom or Google Meet and interacting with courses primarily through
        Canvas. Now that we are more or less acclimated to digital learning during the pandemic, we
        have a moment to pause and ask questions. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say we <em>
        need</em> this moment to pause and ask questions before we proceed further along the path of
        digital pedagogy, lest we be faced with an unexpected turn, the inevitable fork in the path
        we must be prepared for.</p> <!--more-->
      <p>As a student and intern for the CDL, I am curious about how students’ data is being
        collected and used during this time, particularly through the college’s learning management
        system, Canvas. Most of us are aware, to varying degrees, that websites and other platforms
        we interact with track our data. We may not be fully aware of the scope and means of data
        tracking and collection, but we make up for this with a suspended sense of wariness
        surrounding our actions on the internet. We are advised to proceed with caution in arenas we
        do not have a clear understanding of, like the overlap between “big data” and the internet.
        Being aware of where your data is going (and why) is key to maintaining a sense of autonomy
        over your digital self. So, what about data collection on an institutional level? This fall
        semester, almost every SUNY student submitted assignments, wrote discussion posts, took
        quizzes, or otherwise interacted with material on Canvas or a similar learning management
        platform to fulfill their degree requirements. Given our increasing reliance on and trust in
        Canvas, we should take a moment to explore some important questions: How is student data
        collected, both on an institutional level and through third-party applications like Canvas?
        What <em>is</em> the data being collected? And, perhaps most important, to what end is
        students’ data being collected? As students navigating digital learning, it’s important that
        we address these questions and their implications now, both for certainty in our own digital
        autonomy and for that of future college students.</p>
      <p>First, how is student data collected? There is some data we give to Geneseo with our
        implicit consent, like the contents of our college application, SAT and ACT scores, and
        midterm/final grades. The data collected here is straightforward and anticipated: colleges
        require this data to admit students. But other data is collected without our explicit or
        implicit consent, such as data available through student interaction-monitoring on Canvas.
        When we apply to colleges and take exams, we expect certain data to be collected in order to
        reflect our academic achievements and who we are as students. However, many students are not
        aware that their data is being collected and monitored by Canvas with a similar aim. For
        example, a professor may review the number of times a student clicked on a module or page in
        their course as well as the amount of time a student spent on the module or page. Canvas
        automatically collects and analyzes this student data, which is then made accessible to
        faculty and administration. Most of the time, this information is helpful: if a student is
        not engaging with a course, this is reflected in the data collected by Canvas and
        communicated to the professor, who can make the necessary changes to help the student
        succeed. More specific algorithms applied to this data might indicate whether the student
        needs more individual assistance or if there is a larger issue with the professor’s teaching
        style. On the other hand, this information could be misleading. Does a certain number of
        clicks and a certain amount of time spent on material accurately convey a student’s
        engagement with a course? Students might engage with course material in ways that Canvas
        cannot accurately depict, like doing independent research online or participating in lively
        discourse on Zoom. If your learning style deviates from the norm established by Canvas, you
        might be unfairly viewed as an unengaged student. Student data monitoring systems come with
        an embedded assumption that unengaged students (judged as such using Canvas data) are
        irresponsible and less likely to succeed. The monitoring system does not take into account
        different approaches to learning course material, extenuating circumstances in an
        individual’s life, and other forms of human complexity.</p>
      <p>Despite its shortfalls, automated data collection on third-party applications like Canvas
        is often used to assist students and improve academic institutions through the incorporation
        of an early alert system. Early alert systems collect and generate data that serves to
        fulfill the college’s ethical obligation to help students succeed. SUNY Geneseo employs an
        early alert system through Navigate, a product of the higher education research company EAB.
        Navigate collects data on students’ educational progress and performance. It applies
        algorithms to the collected data and presents it in a more complete and helpful form, such
        as using statistical probability to predict a student’s success rate or their likelihood to
        change majors. As always, there are good and bad applications of this data. If a college
        doesn’t care whether its students succeed, it might ignore data that indicates a struggling
        student and do nothing to intervene. SUNY Geneseo collects and frequently reviews students’
        data in order to ensure student success by staging student interventions when necessary. For
        example, Geneseo administration can view which students have registered for the next
        semester and which students have not. As a university committed to student success, Geneseo
        reaches out to the unregistered students to find what support or guidance they may need. The
        algorithms used in early alert systems give faculty and administration insight that might be
        beneficial to share with struggling students; for example, a biology major who recieves
        mostly C’s and is uncertain about their future in the major might be better suited as an
        anthropology major, based on data collected for that particular student as well as data
        collected for all biology majors at the institution. In this sense, the collection of
        student data in all forms helps an institution make important decisions and see what areas
        they need to invest in to better support students.</p>
      <p>Since this data collection occurs at an institutional level, it is also beneficial for
        reviewing and improving the processes of the institution itself. EAB collects student data
        from colleges nationwide in order to judge institutional success rates. This information is
        essential in its ability to inform needed institutional shifts and community-based change.
        Recently, EAB created the <a href="https://eab.com/moon-shot-for-equity/">Moonshot for
          Equity</a> initiative in response to data collected from higher education institutions
        that indicated overwhelming equity gaps faced by students of color. This is an example of
        institutional data collection put to a great purpose. But we should remain somewhat
        skeptical of data collection on a more individualized scale.</p>
      <p>While monitoring students’ educational progess through Canvas is performed with good
        intentions, we should recognize and attempt to redress its ethical issues. Canvas outlines
        the type of data they collect in their privacy policy, which seems innocuous until the final
        line:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>To make our Site, Apps, and Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted
          by a third-party service provider) collect information from you, including browser type,
          operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address…domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for
          your visit. We also use cookies and web beacons (as described below) and navigational data
          like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of
          your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and which you viewed.
          Like most Internet services, we automatically gather this data and store it in log files
          each time you visit our Site, use our Apps, or access your account on our network. <strong>We
          may link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.</strong>
          (Instructure 2018)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Since our data is being collected without our explicit or implicit consent, why is it
        permissible for an outside party to make personal inferences about students based on this
        data? Can the data collected by learning management platforms truly reflect who we are as
        individuals? Learning analytics, which is an advanced form of data-mining not used by Canvas
        at this time, strives to compose a “data-double” of the individual, a move that flattens our
        human complexity: “in doing so, individuals are taken from a corporeal whole and transformed
        into binary code as ‘data doubles’ with the purpose of changing ‘the body into pure
        information, such that it can be rendered more mobile and comparable.’ The problem is that
        the data double fails to be a ‘comprehensive or representative’ reflection of human life,
        yet powerful actors use it to influence a person’s behavior” (Jones 2019). Ascribing
        identity based on data collected without our awareness or consent seems unethical,
        regardless of its ends. For one, the data collected by LMS’s may yield an inaccurate profile
        that “follows” us from one institution to another, impacting our future education and career
        opportunities, especially if we use (and are used) by LMS’s from an early age. This is
        especially concerning right now, when LMS’s are being used in the K-12 setting more than
        ever before. More generally, “students may rightfully be worried that the data and insights
        mined from [Canvas] will become a part of their permanent educational record and lead to
        decontextualized decision making” (Jones 2019). We have limited control over the algorithmic
        calculations that prescribe us identities on these platforms, especially when it is unclear
        precisely which data wields the most weight. We have even less control over where this
        information ends up. Recently, Canvas was purchased by a private investment equity firm for
        two billion dollars, rendering our data more vulnerable than ever: “With no federal privacy
        laws governing student data brokers, student data can be collected, sold, and bought without
        any apparent legal protections from widespread exploitation” (Mariachi and Quill 2020).</p>
      <p>Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus last spring, we depend on Canvas as a learning
        tool more than ever, and rejecting its widespread use is not a viable option. Despite a
        seeming lack of control over our own data within this system, we shouldn’t feel powerless.
        In fact, now that this information is gradually becoming more transparent, we should feel
        empowered to make informed decisions based on our new awareness. Part of this awareness is
        recognizing and questioning the current opacity concerning information practices in higher
        education. To start, many students are not aware of the extent to which their data is
        gathered, not to mention to what end the institution is gathering this information. Since
        it’s their data being collected, students retain the right to question institutional data
        collection policies, and demand a clearer communication of these policies. Further, students
        should exercise their individual agency by holding the hard line on questions concerning
        consent and control. If the system was created with improvement in mind, why is consent
        absent from the model? If we are not extended the ability to consent to data collection and
        analysis within a learning management system like Canvas, it’s up to us to demand answers to
        questions regarding our personal privacy. Students must remember that their voice, both as
        individuals and as a collective, matters, and is a powerful force for addressing
        institutional oversights.</p>
      <p>Moving forward, we should remain cognizant of the tension between modes of data collection:
        its ability to both help and harm students. Improvements to the learning management model
        are needed to reduce its potential for causing harm. Chief among these improvements would be
        informing students and faculty how and why their data is being collected, and then offering
        them the ability to consent to this collection, or otherwise decide how their data will be
        used. We might also envision alternative, open-source platforms that offer a space for
        digital learning without the threat of student data being collected and sold by third-party
        applications. It is our right as students to address the policies that unfairly affect us,
        but it is also our ethical duty to exercise agency for ourselves and our information when
        our autonomy is threatened. We can recognize the good that comes from institutional data
        collection while simultaneously questioning the ethics of nonconsenusal, automated data
        collection on an individual level. Asking questions is the humble beginning of enacting
        lasting changes. If we ignore our opportunity to ask these questions, if we are silent in
        this moment, we risk power going unchecked, incurring changes that may prove more harmful
        than helpful to college students nationwide.</p>

      <p>To adequately assess the effectiveness of an institution’s online programming, we must
        evaluate at least two things: institutional inputs (the organization and implementation of
        the programming) and student outcomes (the skills and knowledge obtained by students in the
        program). This session will explore three different lenses through which to evaluate
        institutional inputs: instructional design, pedagogy, and institutional values. Although
        each of these lenses makes visible all the important aspects of input-related effectiveness,
        each also brings certain of these aspects into sharp focus. Adequately assessing
        effectiveness requires that we inspect and measure our programming through all three lenses.
        The session will invite discussion about the best way to accomplish this goal.</p>

      <p>This one-hour workshop is a continuation of our last workshop, and will teach you how to
        run a number of basic but powerful computer programs using simple, text-based commands.
        Knowing how to communicate with your computer in this elemental way will empower you to
        explore new directions in your scholarly and creative projects. This workshop will be
        presented by Paul Schacht, Director of the CDL, with assistance from yours truly.</p>
      <p>Even if you didn’t make it to Part I you should find this session accessible, as we’ll be
        working through the same modules we covered in the first workshop. We hope to see you there!</p>

      <p>The irony is not lost on us that the only place these videos seem to live on the internet
        is ProPublica’s Facebook account, even though Facebook plays a prominent role as the
        series’s Most Wanted for wild-west-style data collection tactics. Additionally, each article
        features its own relevant internet tool, one of which being a Chrome extension that shows
        you what data Facebook has on you; while attempting to “break” an algorithmic black box, the
        writers encourage readers to engage with another infamous data-monger.</p>
      <p>For now, however, we’ll take all the education we can get on these increasingly influencial
        digital mechanisms, while continuing to apply a critical eye to how and why that information
        gets to us.</p>

    <title>December 2020 newsletter</title>

      <p><span class="drop">T</span>he CDL is starting a newsletter! As we wrap up our first
        semester of operation at Geneseo, we realized how much we’ve accomplished and how much we
        have to look forward to. After chatting with some of the members of our <a
          href="https://www.geneseo.edu/cdl/faculty-affiliates">Faculty Affiliates</a> group during
        a weekly meeting, we realized that there are more ways that we can communicate our
        accomplishments, goals, and upcoming events and plans with the Geneseo community, one of
        which being a regular newsletter!</p>
      <p>In this newsletter, expect to find some highlights of our monthly activities, upcoming
        events, as well as some quick tech tips and tricks to motivate our followers to play around
        and experiment with their computers in between our workshops. This month, we’ve chosen to
        celebrate the completion of our first semester, the success of our first ever workshop, the
        existence of our blog (not that <em>you</em>, dear blog-reader, need any info about that!),
        and our upcoming focus groups, which we announced in a <a

      <p><span class="drop">A</span>s we find ourselves nearing the end of another unconventional
        semester, it is as hard to believe that we’ve been going through this life-altering pandemic
        since March as it is hard to remember anything from the “before time.” Something that began
        as an unexpected emergency move in the spring shifted to “the plan” for the fall; but, be
        assured, it’s virtually impossible (no pun intended) to actually make an effective plan for
        such a massive shift that quickly. We’re still very much in emergency mode.</p>
      <p>While it may start to feel like this won’t ever end, it will. And when it does, things sure
        aren’t going to go back to the way they were. So, it’s really important that we figure out a
        plan, a real plan, going forward.</p> <!--more-->
      <p>At the Center for Digital Learning, that’s one thing we’re here to do in our first year:
        spark, encourage, and support conversations around the future of digital learning at
        Geneseo. Geneseo needs a strategic plan for digital learning, and the starting point for
        that plan needs to be input from faculty and students.</p>
      <p>That’s why the CDL is excited to announce that we will be holding several focus groups over
        the next few months composed of 5-10 student participants and run by members of the <a
          href="https://www.geneseo.edu/cdl/student-affiliates">CDL Student Affiliate Program</a>,
        Student Association, and Presidential Scholars. Through these focus groups we are eager to
        learn more about questions like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How are things going with digital learning this semester?</li>
        <li>What obstacles are you facing during remote learning?</li>
        <li>What do you need from us to help you be productive and successful online students?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It’s our hope that we can not only provide students with an opportunity to talk through and
        connect with other students who might be experiencing similar challenges or obstacles in
        their online learning, but also take these experiences and use them to directly inform the
        development of Geneseo’s strategic plan around digital learning. We want our students to see
        this plan clearly reflect and address what they’ve seen as ineffective during this emergency
        remote learning time first hand. Only then can we start to move toward something better,
        empowered by a well-informed plan.</p>
      <p>We’re excited to learn from you!</p>

      </p>
      <p><span class="drop">N</span>ext week, The Center for Digital Learning kicks off a series of
        workshops called <strong>&lt;the elements /&gt;</strong>. As the name suggests, it’s a
        series focused on elemental computing skills — skills that increase your power and autonomy
        as a scholar, creator, or citizen.</p>
      <p>The first workshop in the series takes place on <strong>November 19 at 4:15 pm</strong> in
        Zoom. <em>Talk to Me: Communicating with Your Computer Through the Command Line</em> will
        teach participants how to run a number of basic but powerful programs using simple,
        text-based commands rather than clicking on the icons of files and folders in their
        computer’s default interface.</p> <!--more-->
      <p>Knowing how to communicate with our computers in this elemental way is the first step
        toward learning how to do the sorts of things that many of us, increasingly, find necessary
        to our research — such as scraping the web for statistical data or textual content we’d like
        to analyze.</p>
      <p>Even more important, perhaps, it’s the first step toward ending our reliance on the pretty
        wrapper that Apple or Microsoft has put around our computers’ operating systems — a wrapper
        that simplifies the computing experience at the cost of obscuring how our computers actually
        do their work.</p>
      <p>Who is this workshop for? <em>You</em> — no matter what your current skill-level. We’ll
        take it slow!</p>
      <p>The workshop is limited to 30 participants. To register, go to <a

        Information Technology, the Office of the Provost, and faculty in the Department of
        Communication have collaborated to launch a competition for the most uplifting tales of
        living and learning at Geneseo this fall under the shadow of Covid-19.</p>
      <p>In an email sent to the campus community today, Dr. Melanie Blood, Interim Associate
        Provost for Assessment and Curriculum and Professor of English and Music, writes:</p> <!--more-->
      <blockquote>
        <p>2020 has been tough on all of us. But in spite of the difficulties, we’ve remained
          resilient and strong. We’ve found creative ways to stay active and connected and to enjoy
          being on campus while still respecting the restrictions necessary to keep everyone healthy
          and safe.</p>
        <p>We want to know how you’ve done it! We’re asking you to share a short clip that
          represents how you’ve found one or more sources of joy, inspiration, humor, hope,
          solidarity, or gratitude in these challenging circumstances. We’re hoping that these clips
          will not only demonstrate Geneseo students’ collective resilience but also provide hope
          and cheer — and maybe even a few good ideas — to those in our community who’ve been
          struggling.</p>
        <p>Clips (either audio or video) should be about 30 seconds long and imaginatively capture
          whatever it is that’s been a bright spot in your 2020 experience. The most inspirational
          clips will be named finalists (by a team of faculty and staff) and featured on the Geneseo
          website. The whole campus community will be invited to vote on favorites, and those voted
          the very best by a Geneseo wide survey will win prizes. Finalists are eligible for prizes,
          including gift cards and Geneseo swag.</p>
        <p>Clips should be submitted to <a href="https://cloud.ensemblevideo.com/Dropbox/COVIDTales">our
          Ensemble Dropbox</a> before December 7. Audio clips must be submitted as MP3 files. Video
          clips must be MOV or MP4/M4V file formats. We’ve assembled some <a
            href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18SRpscVsuGRcBlcjfF0e9mT3s8P2I8Ou?usp=sharing">stock
          footage of Geneseo events</a> for those prevented by social distancing or other obstacles
          from shooting their own video. (And even if you do shoot your own, you’re welcome to
          combine this with it.)</p>
        <p>Finalists will be notified and their work placed on line for viewing and voting by
          December 11, by Geneseo’s Communications and Marketing team.</p>
        <p>All clips should consist of original work to which you own the intellectual rights. Any
          music not created by the participating team must be legally licensed through a site such
          as <a
            href="https://creativecommons.org/about/program-areas/arts-culture/arts-culture-resources/legalmusicforvideos/">Creative
          Commons</a> with proper attribution supplied. By submitting, you are agreeing to the use
          of your work on the Geneseo web site and social media, and you should ensure anyone whose
          image or words you include agrees to that use. See <a

        through going to the medical frontlines of this pandemic, taking to the streets to
        demonstrate against social injustice, adding childcare to your school or workday, or casting
        your vote, we’ve all had to take action this year in, at times, unexpected ways.
        International Open Access Week is yet another opportunity for our community of open
        advocates “to coordinate in taking action to make openness the default for research and to

      <p><span class="drop">W</span>ith the General Election less than a month away, it’s important
        that our students know how to exercise what’s arguably their most significant responsibility
        as a U.S. citizen: their right to vote.</p>
      <p>In order to help my students learn about the voting process, I <a
          href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-add-an-announcement-in-a-course/ta-p/1194">created
        an Announcement on Canvas</a> that succinctly summarizes the <a
          href="https://lor.instructure.com/resources/e889c8cc88a244c3ab04d4b8035c72f3?shared">three
        ways to cast a vote in the General Election</a> in New York state. I was inspired by a
        mailer that I received from the <a href="https://www.monroecounty.gov/elections">Monroe
        County Board of Elections</a> that provided the same information in an easily digestible
        format. (If my link above to the Announcement doesn’t take you directly to it in Canvas, you
        can find it by going to your Canvas dashboard, clicking the link to <em>Commons</em>, and
        searching for it in the Geneseo Commons. Look for an image of the Statue of Liberty.)</p> <!--more-->
      <p>Initially, I sent the Announcement out only to my own courses. But the more I thought about
        it, the more I realized that the Announcement could be useful not only to students, but to
        faculty who similarly wanted to empower students to cast their votes. I decided to <a
          href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Commons/How-do-I-share-a-resource-to-Commons/ta-p/1798">share
        my Announcement on Canvas Commons</a> and then circulate the link to the Canvas resource on
        the Faculty-L listserv. The goal was to provide my faculty colleagues with an easy,
        ready-made resource on voting to share with their students.</p>
      <p>Here are the reasons why you should consider incorporating my Announcement into your Canvas
        courses, too.</p>
      <p><strong>Voting is important.</strong> It’s the cornerstone of our democracy. And in today’s
        climate, everything is politicized. Students should let their voices be heard, and they only
        get the opportunity to do so at the national level every two years.</p>
      <p><strong>Voting is complicated.</strong> One of the most significant barriers to voting is
        navigating the rules and regulations of the voting process itself. This year, factor in a
        pandemic, and voting can feel impossible. Providing students with easily digestible
        information on how to cast their vote helps remove this barrier.</p>
      <p><strong>Young people don’t vote.</strong> Just 13% of <a
          href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/08/09/an-examination-of-the-2016-electorate-based-on-validated-voters/">validated
        voters in 2016</a> were younger than 30. While citizens 65 years and older turned out at a
        rate of 70.9 percent, <a
          href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2017/05/voting_in_america.html">18-
        to 29-year-olds turned out at a rate of 46.1 percent</a> in 2016. Yet elections have huge
        implications for young people and their futures.</p>
      <p><strong>Faculty are role models.</strong> Students respect faculty and are inspired by many
        aspects of our courses. As mentors in positions of authority, we can empower students to
        take action just by mentioning voting and providing them with the basic information on how
        to cast their votes.</p>
      <p><strong>Canvas makes it easy.</strong> Whether you’re teaching remote or face-to-face,
        Canvas is an excellent way to communicate with your students. In order to share my
        Announcement with your students, you can easily <a
          href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Commons/How-do-I-import-and-view-a-Commons-resource-in-Canvas/ta-p/1808">import
        it from Canvas Commons</a> right into your own Canvas courses and edit as you wish.</p>
      <p><strong>This is a simple yet meaningful action.</strong> This year’s election may prove to
        be one of the most important in U.S. history. At the same time, faculty are struggling with
        unprecedented workloads. I hope that this Canvas resource can provide a small amount of
        relief for those of us who want to do something meaningful, but often feel like we don’t
        have the time.</p>

      <p><span class="drop">T</span>he Office of the Provost is excited to offer a new round of
        faculty <a href="https://forms.gle/zxuRPPuTEoiEtJ2JA">incentives for Intersession 2021</a>.</p>
      <p>Before planning to take advantage of one of these incentives, please be sure to check with
        your department chair or dean about any courses you intend to teach. Remember that
        department chairs and deans, not individual faculty, submit courses for inclusion in the
        intersession schedule.</p> <!--more-->
      <p>Intersession 2021 will run for four weeks (January 4-29) rather than the usual three.</p>
      <p>Faculty base compensation for Intersession 2021 is $1000 per credit hour, assuming that the
        course enrolls at least eight students. Below eight students, a faculty member may agree to
        accept a prorated salary; otherwise, the course will be canceled.</p>
      <p>Faculty may teach no more than two Intersession 2021 course sections, for a maximum of
        eight credit hours.</p>
      <p>Faculty who agree to teach high-enrollment sections (with a cap of 40 or more students)
        will earn double the base salary if the course enrolls 31 or more students. Faculty may not
        teach multiple sections of the same course.</p>
      <p>Chairs have the discretion to limit offerings to ensure courses offered enroll sufficiently
        to run. Departments should not offer a second section of a given course unless the first one
        fills.</p>
      <h2 id="1-section-enrollment-incentive">1. Section enrollment incentive</h2>
      <p>If you teach a three- or four-credit course in Intersession 2021 that has twelve or more
        students enrolled after the add-drop period, you’ll receive $500 compensation in addition to
        the standard compensation of $1000 per credit hour. You can earn this incentive for a
        maximum of two courses in Intersession 2021.</p>
      <h2 id="2-course-improvement-or-antiracism-incentive">2. Course improvement <em>or</em>
        antiracism incentive</h2>
      <p>Choose one of the following:</p>
      <h3 id="a-course-improvement-incentive">A. Course improvement incentive</h3>
      <p>For a three- or four-credit course that you teach in Intersession 2021, you can earn $500
        compensation in addition to the base compensation of $1000 per credit hour for adopting
        certain best practices for online instruction that you haven’t previously implemented. Below
        is a short list of examples. It’s not exhaustive; you may be able to earn the incentive for
        implementing practices other than these. To earn this incentive, you must (1) meet with an
        instructional designer in CIT to agree upon appropriate best practices to implement and (2)
        Complete the required items in CIT’s Course Readiness Checklist and implement the practices
        in your Canvas course(s) by December 14, 2020. Payment of this incentive is contingent on
        CIT acknowledgment that the agreed-upon practices were successfully implemented by the
        deadline.</p>
      <p>Representative examples of best-practice improvements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Modifying assignments and assessments for the online environment, including creating
          rubrics to evaluate student work.</li>
        <li>Adding prerequisites and requirements to modules that help track student progress
          through the course.</li>
        <li>Adding introduction and conclusion pages to “bookend” each module in a course.</li>
        <li>Applying Universal Design Principles to a course in order to provide multiple means of
          engagement, representation, and expression.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="b-antiracism-incentive">B. Antiracism incentive</h3>
      <p>For a three- or four-credit course that you teach in Intersession 2021, you can earn $500
        compensation in addition to the base compensation of $1000 per credit hour for any of the
        following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Teaching a <strong>course</strong> that <em>deals centrally</em> with issues of race and
          racial justice in a way that advances <a
            href="https://www.geneseo.edu/tlc/becoming-antiracist-college-project">Geneseo’s 2020-21
          initiative of <em>Becoming an Antiracist College</em></a>. (If you fully develop such a
          course in Canvas for Intersession 2021 and enrollment is insufficient for the course to
          run, you can still earn the incentive if you share the course in Geneseo Canvas Commons.
          In that case, original content must be Creative Commons-licensed, so that other Geneseo
          faculty may make use of it in their own courses. If the course enrolls sufficiently and
          you teach it, neither sharing nor CC-licensing is required. Recipients of this incentive
          must commit to publishing, no later than March 1, 2021 a post on this blog explaining how
          the course advanced the college’s initiative.)</li>
        <li>Including one or more <strong>modules</strong>, in a course that does <em>not</em> deal
          centrally with issues of race and racial justice, engaging these issues in a way that is
          related to the course topic and advances Geneseo’s 2020-21 <em>Becoming an Antiracist
          College</em> initiative. (The module[s] <em>must</em> be shared in Geneseo Canvas Commons,
          and original content <em>must</em> be Creative Commons-licensed, so that other Geneseo
          faculty may incorporate the module[s] into their own courses.)</li>
        <li>Incorporating <strong>content</strong> (readings, lectures and other explanatory
          content, activities, etc.), in a course that does <em>not</em> deal centrally with issues
          of race and racial justice, engaging these issues in a way that is related to the course
          topic and advances Geneseo’s 2020-21 initiative of <em>Becoming an Antiracist College</em>.
          (All original content <em>must</em> be shared in Geneseo Canvas Commons and Creative
          Commons-licensed, so that other Geneseo faculty may incorporate the content into their own
          courses. Recipients of this incentive must commit to publishing, no later than March 1,
          2021 a post on this blog explaining how the race and racial justice content informed the
          course.)</li>
      </ol>
      <h2 id="general-requirements-and-reminders">General requirements and reminders</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>For the section enrollment incentive, no instructor may earn more than $1000 (one
          payment each of $500 for two <em>different</em> courses that enroll sufficiently and run).</li>
        <li>The minimum enrollment for a course to run at full base compensation is <strong>eight</strong>
          students.</li>
        <li>The minimum enrollment for a course to be eligible for the section enrollment incentive
          is <strong>twelve</strong> students.</li>
        <li>For the course-improvement incentive, no instructor may earn more than $500.</li>
        <li>For the antiracism incentive, no instructor may earn more than $500.</li>
        <li>For each course, the instructor may earn either the course-improvement <em>or</em> the
          antiracism incentive.</li>
        <li>The maximum amount that any instructor may receive in incentive payments for a single
          course in Intersession 2021 is $1000, or $1500 for two courses.</li>
        <li>All incentives other than the enrollment incentive will be awarded only for courses that

      <p><span class="drop">A</span>s a result of the coronavirus pandemic, many more Geneseo
        faculty are teaching online. Not surprisingly, then, department chairs, deans, and personnel
        committees are wondering how they can best evaluate their colleagues’ online instruction for
        the purposes of professional development and review.</p>
      <p>Procedures and standards for peer review of faculty are, of course, properly a matter for
        shared governance and contractual negotiation. At some point it will fall to Geneseo’s
        college senate to approve guidelines for “observing” online instruction similar to <a
          href="https://wiki.geneseo.edu/download/attachments/109184288/Classroom%20Observation%20Procedures%20and%20Criteria.pdf?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1479164407556&amp;api=v2">those
        it adopted in 2006 for on-ground instruction</a>, possibly together with some
        online-specific modifications to the personnel evaluation forms for tenured/tenure-track and
        adjunct faculty. But because schools and departments need help with this question right now,
        I put down some thoughts and shared them with the CDL <a
          href="https://www.geneseo.edu/cdl/faculty-affiliates">faculty affiliates</a>, <a
          href="https://www.geneseo.edu/cdl/student-affiliates">student affiliates</a>, <a
          href="https://www.geneseo.edu/cdl/cdl-associates">associates</a>, and <a
          href="https://www.geneseo.edu/cdl/leadership">leadership team</a>, as well as the Academic
        Experience Planning Team convened last spring by Provost Robertson to develop
        recommendations for the transition to remote learning. I also consulted Wes Kennison,
        Geneseo UUP chapter president. I got a lot of terrific feedback, especially in the faculty
        affiliates’ meeting on September 9.</p> <!--more-->
      <p>What follows isn’t a group document but rather my best advice, informed by the range of
        perspectives I heard in that feedback. As you might expect, the perspectives didn’t line up
        neatly, but there was significant disagreement on only one point, which I discuss below.</p>
      <p>I’m especially grateful to Wes for his precise insistence on the difference between
        mentorship and personnel review as processes. While the advice below raised no red flags for
        him, he cautioned that his personal lack of objection should not be construed as an official
        union endorsement.</p>
      <h2 id="tldr-edition">Tl;dr edition</h2>
      <p>For those who like their conclusions first, here’s the short version of my advice:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Be guided by best practice for evaluating online instruction, but adapt it to present
          circumstances: faculty workloads and pressures right now call for a streamlined approach
          that respects everyone’s limited time as well as the psychological strains on colleagues
          under review, especially those without tenure.</li>
        <li>In establishing a temporary procedure for your school or department, consider the
          difference between physical and online spaces when it comes to both faculty’s and
          students’ sense of privacy and safety. Various online equivalents to the conventional
          collegial classroom visit may leave some people feeling uncomfortably exposed or
          surveilled and could cause some students to feel as though their trust has been violated.</li>
        <li>Whatever approach your school or department takes, make sure everyone fully understands
          the why and how of it and that everyone follows it consistently.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="two-questions-not-one">Two questions, not one</h2>
      <p>For Geneseo right now, the question of how best to evaluate online teaching is really two
        questions. First, in the abstract, what constitutes best practice for peer evaluation and
        mentorship in this area? But second, what’s a fair, reasonable, and practicable approach to
        assessing and mentoring colleagues under our present unusual circumstances, where many
        instructors, evaluators, and students are operating in unfamiliar territory, with new
        instructional modalities and with tools they may be trying for the first time?</p>
      <p>Best practice calls for a thorough review of an instructor’s online course design and
        content in light of widely accepted, research-based standards. Many institutions use the <a
          href="https://www.qualitymatters.org/why-quality-matters/process">adaptable,
        standards-driven review process</a> developed by <a href="https://www.qualitymatters.org/">Quality
        Matters</a>, a nonprofit organization that grew out of a higher-education consortium in
        Maryland. In collaboration with the <a href="https://onlinelearningconsortium.org/">Online
        Learning Consortium</a>, SUNY has developed its own instrument for developing and assessing
        online courses, the Online Course Quality Review Rubric: <a href="https://oscqr.suny.edu/">
        OSCQR</a> for short. Both tools have the advantage of being backed by extensive research on
        effective online instruction. They’re thorough and detailed: OSCQR, for example, comprises
        50 standards arranged under six dimensions of online course architecture and implementation:
        Overview and Information, Technology and Tools, Design and Layout, Content and Activities,
        Interaction, Assessment and Feedback.</p>
      <p>However, these tools are intended as frameworks for the full online course evaluation
        process, from development through review to improvement. They presume an instructor who’s
        deliberately chosen to teach online and to build courses informed by the tools’ design
        principles. They also presume evaluators thoroughly familiar with those principles.</p>
      <p>Needless to say, that’s not the situation we’re in right now.</p>
      <h2 id="realistic-alternatives-to-best-practice">Realistic alternatives to best practice</h2>
      <p>Under present circumstances, a better approach to evaluating instructors’ courses would be
        to rate them against just a few, high-level principles of effective practice. One starting
        point might be Geneseo’s <a
          href="https://wp.geneseo.edu/etc/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2020/04/course-readiness-checklist-v3.pdf">Course
        Readiness Checklist</a>, the greatly streamlined version of OSCQR developed by CDL Assistant
        Director for Online Learning Laurie Fox and her team of instructional designers in CIT.
        Departments could adapt it to fit distinctive aspects of their disciplines or cultures.</p>
      <p>Another possible starting point is the “Seven Principles for Good Practice in Undergraduate
        Education” distilled from research on student learning by Arthur Chickering and Zelda Gamson
        in their <a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED282491.pdf">influential 1987 article</a>
        of that name. Because these principles apply to every course modality, from fully in-person
        to varieties of hybrid to fully online, they’re likely to be recognized and understood by
        the largest number of faculty. It’s no accident that they track well with the indicators of
        effective “Contributions to Teaching” listed in the “Appendix” to Geneseo’s <a
          href="https://wiki.geneseo.edu/x/IAWCBg">Personnel Evaluation Form (PER) as updated in May
        2019</a>.</p>
      <p>The best undergraduate teaching, Chickering and Gamson argued,</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Encourages contacts between students and faculty</li>
        <li>Develops reciprocity and cooperation among students</li>
        <li>Uses active learning techniques</li>
        <li>Gives prompt feedback</li>
        <li>Emphasizes time on task</li>
        <li>Communicates high expectations</li>
        <li>Respects diverse talents and ways of learning</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I’m not keen on the phrase “Emphasizes time on task,” but properly translated it simply
        means that good teaching communicates clear expectations for how students should apportion
        their time in realizing a course’s learning outcomes. This clarity is especially important
        in asynchronous online courses, where students bear responsibility for effectively managing
        the 2,000-plus minutes that an in-person three-credit course, for example, fixes in class
        meetings.</p>
      <p>At <a href="https://facdev.e-education.psu.edu/evaluate-revise/peerreviewonline">Penn State
        College of Earth and Mineral Sciences</a>, Ann Taylor, a member of the Dutton E-Education
        Institute, developed a Creative Commons-licensed <a
          href="https://facdev.e-education.psu.edu/sites/default/files/PeerReview_OnlineCourses_PSU_Guide_13June2017.pdf">Peer-Review
        Guide for Online Courses</a> based on Chickering and Gamson’s seven principles. Taylor’s
        peer-review guide indicates where reviewers could look within an online course to see how
        the course measures up against these principles.</p>
      <p>Geneseo deans, department chairs, and personnel committees might consider adapting Taylor’s
        guide to come up with a form and a process that reflects the particular ways in which their
        respective disciplines realize the seven principles; weaves in additional high-level Geneseo
        values such as equity, inclusion, and accessibility; and respects the constraints of time
        and experience under which we’re all operating right now.</p>
      <p>Faculty undergoing personnel review typically prepare a self-reflective statement together
        with evidence of their teaching effectiveness that includes course materials (syllabi,
        handouts, assignments, etc.) and examples of student work. In writing reflectively about
        their online teaching, faculty might describe how they see the design and content of their
        online courses meeting the discipline-specific version of standards such as those described
        above. Additionally, as evidence of growth, they might explain how they’ve changed their
        online teaching in light of previous experience. And they might illustrate their
        effectiveness by including examples of student engagement such as de-identified excerpts
        from discussion forums.</p>
      <h2 id="transparency-consistency-privacy">Transparency, consistency, privacy</h2>
      <p>Whatever approach is taken, the important thing is to <em>make sure the process and the
        standards it employs are transparent to faculty under review and followed consistently by
        reviewers.</em> Taylor’s guide spells out how Penn State instructors should initiate and
        reviewers carry out their process. Academic departments at Geneseo should do the same.</p>
      <p>However it works, the process will require instructors to share their course design and
        content with one or more peers. It’s best <em>not</em> to have them do this by simply
        granting peers access to the course in Canvas. Students who’ve contributed to the course’s
        online discussion forums, posted videos, and otherwise shared their views and ideas with the
        instructor or classmates weren’t expecting these outsiders to be part of their audience.</p>
      <p>CIT can instead clone the course so that peers can see its structure and instructional
        content but no student-generated content. To give reviewers a feel for how they engage
        students in active learning, instructors can, as suggested above, include de-identified
        samples of student work as part of their self-reflection.</p>
      <h2 id="what-about-synchronous-observation">What about synchronous observation?</h2>
      <p>When evaluating physically present teaching, we traditionally attach great importance to
        classroom visits, which give us the opportunity to see how a colleague interacts with
        students. Online, there’s no classroom to visit, so course design and content become the
        most important indicators of quality — not only out of necessity, but because the absence of
        a classroom makes them that much more essential to effective instruction and student
        success.</p>
      <p>If an online course has a synchronous component or is mainly synchronous, however, it’s
        possible for a colleague to “drop in” on a Zoom lecture or discussion in an attempt to get a
        feel for an instructor’s pedagogical style. Is this a good idea?</p>
      <p>We’ve arrived at the one point on which the colleagues I consulted in preparing this blog
        post had significant disagreement, with a small number arguing that by visiting a live
        synchronous meeting or watching a recorded one, a peer reviewer might gain meaningful
        insight into a colleague’s effectiveness with minimal disruption to the class as a
        community.</p>
      <p>My own advice is: don’t do it. I’m skeptical about the insight and very concerned about the
        impact on community — as a general matter, but particularly right now.</p>
      <p>I can imagine a future — hopefully a pandemic-free one — where videoconferencing has become
        so commonplace and the technology has made it so intuitive that we can all read people’s
        conferencing interactions as easily as we do their in-person ones, a future where we can
        confidently assess the online equivalent of how well a colleague “uses the board” or
        facilitates a sense of community in a physical classroom. (How nimble is their
        screen-sharing? How effectively do they use breakout rooms? Are students genuinely engaged?)
        But until we get there, and considering that many faculty are working hard to gain fluency
        with a raft of new tools and methods for live online engagement, I worry that reviewers will
        reach unwarranted conclusions while generating tremendous stress for their colleagues.</p>
      <p>I worry, too, that a visit to a synchronous online meeting may feel “creepy” to some
        students in a way that a visit to a physical classroom doesn’t, in part because online
        there’s little if any possibility of anonymity. Student experience here may be shaped in
        part by the sense that in general the educational sector is watching them constantly, <a
          href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/12/24/colleges-are-turning-students-phones-into-surveillance-machines-tracking-locations-hundreds-thousands/">using
        their phones to track their movements around campus</a>, <a
          href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/seanlawson/2020/04/24/are-schools-forcing-students-to-install-spyware-that-invades-their-privacy-as-a-result-of-the-coronavirus-lockdown/#61d94975638d">asking
        them to install spyware on their computers in an effort to combat academic dishonesty</a>,
        or even <a
          href="https://www.consumerreports.org/colleges-universities/college-board-is-sharing-student-data-once-again">sending
        information about their activity to companies like Facebook and Google</a>. The point isn’t
        that these things are happening at Geneseo but rather that they form part of the climate in
        which students in general now learn. Meanwhile, one thing that <em>is</em> happening here —
        necessarily, and for the best of reasons — is intense daily monitoring of students’ health
        and social contacts. Under the circumstances, I think we’d do well to avoid, where possible,
        adding anything else to the atmosphere that might feel like surveillance.</p>
      <p>Would asking a colleague to record a synchronous online meeting mitigate any of the
        potential harms of a live visit? I suppose it might reduce the colleague’s anxiety somewhat,
        but it wouldn’t remove the surveillance issue and might, in fact, exacerbate it by creating
        a permanent record of the things people said and did in the meeting, with identities
        attached, a record whose future circulation would lie outside any of the participants’
        control. I think faculty have as much reason as students to be wary of such an outcome.</p>
      <p>Here, again, then, my advice is: don’t do it.</p>
      <h2 id="student-opinion">Student opinion</h2>
      <p>It’s worth considering what role student opinion might play in evaluating online teaching.
        At Geneseo, our process for evaluating physically present teaching has for many years
        included student opinion through the SOFI survey. The college senate is currently reviewing
        this practice with an eye toward turning a radically revised SOFI into an instrument for
        formative assessment that would no longer play a role in personnel evaluation. Eventually,
        it may make sense to have a dedicated instrument for evaluating online teaching that would
        serve the same developmental purpose and would be similarly excluded from use in personnel
        decisions. It might ask the kinds of questions that could help a faculty member gauge how
        well they succeeded in, for example, establishing a personal presence, making students feel
        welcome and connected, tying activities and assignments to course learning outcomes, and
        communicating expectations and feedback effectively.</p>
      <p>Whether and how student opinion should play a role in improving online teaching and
        learning at Geneseo is, of course, another matter to be determined through shared
        governance.</p>
      <h2 id="some-final-thoughts">Some final thoughts</h2>
      <p>To repeat, what you’ve been reading here is advice, not policy. Hopefully it’s helpful
        advice at a moment when, without settled policy to guide us, it’s nevertheless important for
        professional development and personnel review processes to continue.</p>
      <p>Throughout this post, I’ve spoken of those two processes in tandem because I’ve been
        focused on identifying the standards to which faculty should look both to become better
        online instructors and to demonstrate how they’re meeting expectations set by their
        departments and the college. While the standards may be the same, however, the processes are
        of course quite different, as are the stakes, particularly for faculty whose continued
        employment at a time of heightened precarity may hang in the balance.</p>
      <p>In developing transparent and consistent standards adapted from best practice with an eye
        toward our unprecedentedly stressful and unsettled moment, then, departments and schools
        should also keep in mind that, from an ethical standpoint they should not, and from a
        contractual standpoint they may not, judge faculty’s performance by criteria of which those
        faculty were not previously informed. To put this more simply: look in Canvas for
        appropriate evidence that faculty are doing, in that environment, and to the best of their
        ability, the things that have been traditionally associated with excellent teaching at
        Geneseo.</p>
      <p>As you look, remember how challenging it’s proving for many faculty to find their feet in a
        teaching environment where they’ve landed suddenly, and not by choice. Pay particular
        attention to the things they’re getting right.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>What role does digital pedagogy play in humanities teaching? Across academia, humanities
          faculty have been experimenting with innovative uses of digital technology that make
          learning more inclusive, participatory, collaborative, transparent, and active. Students
          in humanities disciplines are annotating websites, contributing to public-facing digital
          archives, analyzing texts through computation, encoding digitized documents, engaging in
          multimedia storytelling, sharing knowledge and self-reflection through blogs and podcasts,
          and visualizing humanities data in maps, timelines, and network graphs.</p>
        <p>The SUNY Office of Library and Information Services, SUNY Center for Professional
          Development and SUNY Press are organizing an online gathering Friday, September 25, 2020
          from 1:00 - 2:30 pm to showcase digital pedagogy in the humanities at SUNY. The gathering
          will be organized as a series of short (5-10 minute) presentations by SUNY faculty
          highlighting one course activity that utilizes digital pedagogy.</p>
        <p>This kick-off event will be followed by a series of online events and workshops designed
          to create a community of practice within SUNY focused on how to best utilize digital
          pedagogy to help students achieve learning goals. The community of practice will help
          newcomers to digital pedagogy get started and provide opportunities for more experienced
          practitioners to acquire new skills, tools, and ideas. Another goal of the community of
          practice is to support research about digital pedagogy that faculty can use across the
          spectrum of learning situations, from fully physical to hybrid to fully remote
          instruction.</p>

      <p><span class="drop">W</span>ho am I, and how did I get here?</p>
      <p>I started at SUNY Geneseo as an undergraduate English major in 2014, and I truly had no
        idea what I was doing. People would make assumptions about my plans based on my major and,
        likely out of sheer stubbornness, I would feel compelled to reject each one: No, I’m not
        going to be an English teacher… No, it’s unlikely I’ll be a famous author, but thanks for
        asking.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
      <p>As irritating as these questions were, they were even more so because for a long time I
        couldn’t come back with anything substantial that I actually could see myself doing with a
        degree in English.</p> <!--more-->
      <p>What people were actually asking me, and what I was asking myself, was, what is my “why”?</p>
      <p>I’d actually been admitted to Geneseo as a psychology major, but I had always had English
        in the back of my head as my real educational aspiration. So, out of hopeful curiosity,
        during freshman orientation, I attended a brief talk provided by the English department.
        While Paul Schacht was the Chair of the English department at the time, he was, in usual
        fashion, pulled in many directions that day, and Rob Doggett, who eventually became the
        Chair while I was a student, filled in. Rob talked about how the Geneseo English major was
        working hard to dismantle the stereotype of a solitary white man or woman sitting in a field
        memorizing stanza upon stanza of poetry and, instead, reframe it as a discipline focused on
        things like the power of narrative and community, and how to approach those things
        critically.</p>
      <p>At this point, I was approaching my “ah-ha!” moment when Paul walked in long enough to
        introduce the idea of “digital humanities” and the budding enthusiasm for this field of
        study at Geneseo. I had never heard anyone talk about combining the soft skill of English
        study with anything remotely technical; I was always given the impression that if you were
        good at English, you were inherently bad at anything digital, and proudly labeled myself as
        technologically inept. Now I’m being told that I don’t have to think that way, and that I
        can use these additional skills to enhance my approach to the critical analysis and writing
        that I love? By the time he walked back out the door and Rob resumed administration of the
        session, I was sold.</p>
      <p>When it came time for me to make my schedule for the upcoming fall semester during
        orientation, I was paired with Caroline Woidat, Professor of English and American Studies
        Program Coordinator, which I took as my final cosmic nudge, abruptly asking her to change my
        major before we began, plunging me into a completely different game plan for that session
        and the rest of my undergraduate career in a manner of minutes.</p>
      <p>It took me a year of getting my feet under me as an undergraduate, navigating college life
        and expectations, before I had my gateway experience into the digital humanities world.
        During my sophomore year, in Fall 2015, I took Dr. Woidat’s Women and Literature: Politics
        &amp; Practice of Textual Recovery course. The digital humanities aspect of this course was
        actually a pleasant surprise to me, as I’d originally planned to take this course to fulfill
        my 19th century literature requirement for the major. When we began to dive into digital
        practices in the course, I felt an exhilarating resurgence of that inspiration I felt during
        orientation.</p>
      <p>This course introduced me to a handful of exciting online resources, such as <a
          href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> and <a href="https://archive.org/">Just
        Teach One</a>, but the truly transformational aspect of this course was how it changed the
        way I thought about texts, narrative, representation, and the opportunities digital tools
        provide for more extensive, collaborative textual analysis and criticism. This shift in
        perspective was a crucial turning point in my undergraduate career as I sought out more
        opportunities to connect with narrative and communities in increasingly digital ways.</p>
      <p>By the end of Fall 2017, I was invited to participate in a <a
          href="http://coplacdigital.org/">COPLACDigital</a> course titled <a
          href="http://slob.coplacdigital.org/">The Social Life of Books</a>, a course that required
        its students to create a WP website exploring a collection of books held in their campus
        library. My knowledge and understanding of digital tools, techniques, and practices grew
        explosively and exponentially, resulting in the creation of the <a
          href="http://slob.coplacdigital.org/geneseo/">Solider Librarian at SUNY Geneseo</a>, my
        final project that explored the 3 oldest books in Milne Library’s Special Collections,
        allowing site visitors to explore them in engaging and informational ways. I came away from
        this course with a stronger understanding of not only critical digital practices, but also
        of how these practices can impact learning and collaborative criticism.</p>
      <p>These experiences helped me land my first job after graduation as the Open Education
        Resources (OER) Publishing Coordinator for the SUNY OER Services team. The values I learned
        as a digital humanities student were reinforced by those of the open movement, which is,
        essentially, to democratize knowledge through low-barrier access and collaborative learning.
        In this role, I continued to develop my digital skills, tackling command line, HTML, CSS,
        and more, until I was presented with the opportunity to transition into the role of Digital
        Humanities and Learning Coordinator at the CDL.</p>
      <p>I’ve had a lot of whys along the way, and, given the path here, I’m beyond excited to
        figure out all the new whys ahead.</p>
      <p>Welcome to the ride.</p>

      </p>
      <p><span class="drop">W</span>hat will the first year of SUNY Geneseo’s Center for Digital
        Learning look like? That question was hard enough to answer even before March 2020. When <a
          href="https://www.geneseo.edu/cdl/leadership">Paul Schacht</a> and I first learned of the
        opportunity for us to institute a center that would serve the Geneseo community in its
        efforts to innovatively utilize digital tools and practices in ways that support teaching,
        learning, scholarship, and creativity in late 2019, we excitedly began preparing for its
        arrival.</p> <!--more-->
      <p>Initially, we had visions of a large, open room bustling with activity—people sharing
        ideas, students and faculty actively collaborating, folks huddled around laptops and screens
        to work through tools—and hosting lively, in-person workshops for faculty and students alike
        around campus. Our <a href="https://www.geneseo.edu/cdl/faculty-affiliates">Faculty
        Affiliates</a> and our <a href="https://www.geneseo.edu/cdl/student-affiliates">Student
        Affiliates</a> would represent both our community within our doors as well as the center to
        our community outside of those doors in their work with us. Then, our Center for Digital
        Learning became all the more digital when it became clear that none of those aspirations
        could happen anytime soon as our nation, and the world, shut down.</p>
      <p>This will be a strange and challenging year in ways that make even the most established
        organizations and initiatives feel insecure as they strive to adapt to a new reality, and so
        the uncertainty around beginning a new endeavor such as this is only amplified. However,
        that being said, there’s also a sense that these types of initiatives are increasingly
        necessary. Combine that sense with the excitement of a challenge, and you get our team’s
        determined motivation. Some of what we hoped to do can be converted to virtual alternatives,
        such as our workshops and aspects of collaboration, and some will simply have to wait; that
        hustle and bustle of a physical center will be all the more exhilarating when we can
        experience it safely.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, the CDL at Geneseo will further explore ways to support faculty and
        students as they navigate remote and hybrid learning in conjunction with other high-impact
        learning and student success mechanisms at Geneseo, as identified in <a
          href="https://cdl-geneseo.github.io/2020/07/27/why/">Paul’s introductory post</a>, as <a
          href="https://www.geneseo.edu/cit">CIT</a>, <a href="https://library.geneseo.edu/">Milne
        Library</a>, <a href="https://www.geneseo.edu/accessibility-office">Accessibility Services</a>
        , <a href="https://www.geneseo.edu/dean_office/dean-academic-planning-advising-dapa">Academic
        Planning and Advising</a>, the <a href="https://www.geneseo.edu/cil">Center for Integrative
        Learning</a>, and the <a href="https://www.geneseo.edu/tlc">Teaching and Learning Center</a>.
        With these partners, we’ll provide essential encouragement and innovative problem solving to
        faculty who seek to enrich their pedagogy with digital tools and practices. If nothing else,
        the CDL is riding on a wave of momentum as our community and those around us are inspired,
        if not compelled, to dive into digital teaching practices, and as relevant as we thought our
        goals were in late 2019, they’ve become even more so now.</p>
      <p>We’ll not only prepare for the future we had envisioned, but we’ll also embrace the
        opportunities of the current moment.</p>
      <p>In this first year, we seek to consistently amplify the ambition in the Geneseo community
        to pursue digital learning by cultivating tangible expressions of their efforts through
        integrative micro-credentialing, starting with our talented and digitally hungry students.
        Our Student Affiliates will play a key role in helping us design applied-learning
        experiences for students that are as relevant and attractive as possible. In addition to
        this micro-credential experience, we’re exploring offering 1-credit courses to students
        interested in learning the basics of digital humanities tools and research practices,
        inspired by <a href="https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum">CUNY’s DHRI GitHub courses</a>.</p>
      <p>We’ll hold several virtual workshops this year, open to anyone in the Geneseo community to
        attend, but geared specifically toward faculty who are interested in expanding their digital
        toolkits. Expect to see some general sessions on how to use specific tools for textual
        annotation, open collaboration, and the like. In addition, we’re hoping to announce more
        specialized demonstrations depending on the kind of support we can get from those who have
        expertise in those areas as the year goes on.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the most important goal we have for this upcoming year is to lead the Geneseo
        conversation on the future of digital learning at Geneseo. We’re aiming to address issues
        such as balancing face-to-face and online instruction in the broader campus curriculum and
        in students’ course loads, ultimately drafting an overall strategic plan for digital
        learning at Geneseo. We’ll be relying heavily on our Faculty and Student Affiliates in these
        conversations but are hoping to open this discussion to the larger Geneseo community in a
        structured way. We’re here to listen and to strategize, and to hold voices up even while
        we’re apart.</p>
      <p>So, welcome to our playhouse; we hope you’re ready to begin.</p>

      <p><span class="drop">W</span>hy a Center for Digital Learning? Without a center to hold them,
        things don’t always fall apart, but they don’t necessarily hang together.</p>
      <p>A range of offices and individuals have long worked hard to advance one or more forms of
        digital learning at Geneseo — from online courses, to digital pedagogy in the classroom, to
        research and creative activity at the intersection of digital technology and the liberal
        arts and sciences. The new Center for Digital Learning will bring increased organization and
        coordination to this work.</p> <!--more-->
      <p>Our office in South Hall’s “technology corridor,” which houses a maker space, a computer
        lab, and a <a href="https://wp.geneseo.edu/etc/techtipthursday-one-button-studio/">one-button
        studio</a>, is located just above <a href="https://www.geneseo.edu/cit">CIT</a>’s
        educational technology office and is also near <a href="https://library.geneseo.edu">Milne
        Library</a>’s current home in Fraser Hall. We want it to be <em>the</em> meeting place for
        faculty, students, librarians, technology professionals, and others whose interests and
        expertise converge on a single question: <em>How can Geneseo best support teaching,
          learning, scholarship, and creativity that make innovative use of digital tools and
        methods?</em></p>
      <p>We also want the center to provide conceptual space for this community to inform and teach
        one other, generate new ideas, and develop new intiatives, working hand-in-hand with others
        engaged in supporting high-impact learning and student success at Geneseo through offices
        such as <a href="https://www.geneseo.edu/accessibility-office">Accessibility Services</a>, <a
          href="https://www.geneseo.edu/dean_office/dean-academic-planning-advising-dapa">Academic
        Planning and Advising</a>, the <a href="https://www.geneseo.edu/cil">Center for Integrative
        Learning</a>, and the <a href="https://www.geneseo.edu/tlc">Teaching and Learning Center</a>
        .</p>
      <p>Toward these ends, we’ve assembled a team of <a
          href="https://www.geneseo.edu/cdl/faculty-affiliates">faculty affiliates</a> from the full
        range of Geneseo’s academic disciplines and professional programs, <a
          href="https://www.geneseo.edu/cdl/student-affiliates">student affiliates</a> who will earn
        academic credit as interns, and <a href="https://www.geneseo.edu/cdl/cdl-associates">
        associates</a> who from their respective home locations at Geneseo bring expertise in
        accessibility, student success, and scholarly communications. Our Assistant Director for
        Online Learning, <a href="https://www.geneseo.edu/cdl/leadership">Laurie Fox</a>, is also
        CIT’s longstanding and highly respected Director of Educational Technology.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.geneseo.edu/cdl/leadership">Amanda Wentworth (English, ‘18)</a>, who
        just concluded a two-year appointment in Milne Library as OER Publishing Coordinator for
        SUNY OER Services, is our Digital Humanities and Learning Coordinator. She brings experience
        in web design and digital project management, together with rapidly growing expertise in
        platforms and computational tools for humanities scholarship and education.</p>
      <p>I’m excited to be bringing to this effort my 30 years of teaching experience at Geneseo,
        all of them informed and enabled by digital technology. I arrived here in 1985 with a
        first-generation Apple MacIntosh computer in tow. Email was “e-mail” and the internet had no
        pictures, but the potential of computing to re-shape pedagogy and scholarship, making them
        more open, collaborative, and connected, was already clear. Over the next decade, the web
        came alive with images and turned increasingly social; in the decade that followed, a niche
        area of scholarly interest sometimes described as “humanities computing” re-branded itself
        as “digital humanities” and became, not without controversy, a thing. These developments
        affected me profoundly. By the early years of the new milennium, “Web 2.0” — the social web
        of blogs, discussion forums, and wikis — thoroughly pervaded my teaching. In 2010, in
        collaboration with Milne Library, the Thoreau Society, and the Walden Woods Project, I
        launched <a href="http://digitalthoreau.org">Digital Thoreau</a>, a digital humanities
        initiative focused on both the works of nineteenth-century American author Henry David
        Thoreau and the legacy of 20th-century Thoreau scholar and SUNY Geneseo Distinguished
        Professor of English Walter Harding.</p>
      <p>My year as Geneseo’s interim provost (2016-17) opened my eyes to the remarkable work some
        of my colleagues were doing with technology. I learned how many colleagues shared my
        interest in using the social web to achieve a more transparent and student-centered
        pedagogy. I learned how many colleagues, like me, saw the internet as a powerful engine for
        increasing the world’s access to and understanding of important cultural resources, and for
        vastly improving the circulation of scholarly communications. I learned how many colleagues,
        unlike me, had crossed into the ether to teach courses fully online. From these last
        colleagues I gained a new appreciation for the craft and science behind effective course
        design and engaging online instruction.</p>
      <p>In 2018, as Assistant to the Provost for Digital Learning and Scholarship, I became heavily
        involved in our efforts at Geneseo to offer students more flexibile programming through
        summer and intersession online courses. I began working closely with CIT to provide faculty
        development in online course design and pedagogy. Although I’d benefited throughout my
        career from the deep knowledge and incredible generosity of CIT’s dedicated professionals,
        this was a new, more collaborative relationship. What CIT’s educational technologists
        brought to the collaboration was an already robust faculty development program touching on
        all aspects of classroom technology, including regular workshops and detailed documentation
        in the <a href="https://wiki.geneseo.edu/x/bIVLAw">Geneseo wiki</a>; a well-oiled process
        and set of guiding principles for helping faculty understand basic principles of online
        course quality; and — perhaps most important — an incalculable wealth of faculty trust,
        built on years of effective and widely appreciated service from Director of Educational
        Technology Laurie Fox and instructional-support-coordinator-turned-instructional-designer
        Joe Dolce, together with the skilfullness and fresh outlook of Joe’s more recently hired
        partner in instructional design, Becky Patt.</p>
      <p>What I brought to the collaboration were the experience and pedagogical investments
        described above, as well as the eyes of a faculty member, which narrow at the sight of any
        tool, process, practice, or protocol that looks as though it might confine rather than
        liberate pedagogical creativity.</p>
      <p>The philosophical center of this partnership was our shared view of technology as a means
        to an end — student learning — rather than an end in itself.</p>
      <p>But (to return to where this post began) how was that center represented institutionally at
        Geneseo? What office bore a name that signaled our commitment at all times to put digital
        technology in service to learning? At what table did faculty sit with technologists to
        discuss how Geneseo might find the best path forward for online instruction at a primarily
        liberal arts college traditionally focused on a physically present pedagogy? How were we
        ensuring that student voices would be heard in any consideration of this question? Where on
        an organizational chart or the Geneseo website would one look for evidence of a sustained
        effort to build a community organized by a vision of digital learning — including that
        learning which faculty cultivate and share in the form of scholarship and creative work — as
        a force for equity, access, inclusion, transparency, and agency?</p>
      <p>The CDL’s mission isn’t to create such a community; it already exists. Rather, our mission
        is to strengthen and expand it; to be its visible face; to give it a physical location and
        intellectual room to explore, discuss, debate, and plan; to make the center hold.</p>
      <p>Our agenda for Year One includes running workshops for faculty who want to expand their
        digital toolkits beyond out-of-the-box educational software, designing an integrative
        micro-credential for students in digital humanities and social sciences with an
        applied-learning component, and leading a campus-wide conversation on the future of digital
        learning at Geneseo.</p>
      <p>It’s a huge understatement to say I’m looking forward to it.</p>
